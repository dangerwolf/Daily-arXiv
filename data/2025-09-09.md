TL;DR: CEDAR技术通过模板标准化科学数据集的元数据，以促进FAIR原则。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学家努力使他们的数据集符合FAIR原则，但很难记住所有指导原则，核心需求是丰富、特定领域和标准化的元数据。

Method: CEDAR开发了一种技术，将元数据标准编码为模板，这些模板枚举了不同类型实验的属性，并捕获了数据描述偏好。这些模板可用于Web表单或电子表格。

Result: CEDAR模板已被用于为各种科学联盟标准化元数据，并纠正元数据以确保符合标准。它们以符号形式捕获知识，并可应用于多种环境。

Conclusion: CEDAR模板为科学社区提供了一种机制，用于创建共享元数据标准、编码其应用偏好，并将这些标准部署到智能系统中以促进开放科学。

Abstract: Scientists strive to make their datasets available in open repositories, with
the goal that they be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).
Although it is hard for most investigators to remember all the guiding
principles associated with FAIR data, there is one overarching requirement: The
data need to be annotated with rich, discipline-specific, standardized
metadata. The Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR) builds
technology that enables scientists to encode metadata standards as templates
that enumerate the attributes of different kinds of experiments. These metadata
templates capture preferences regarding how data should be described and what a
third party needs to know to make sense of the datasets. CEDAR templates
describing community metadata preferences have been used to standardize
metadata for a variety of scientific consortia. They have been used as the
basis for data-annotation systems that acquire metadata through Web forms or
through spreadsheets, and they can help correct metadata to ensure adherence to
standards. Like the declarative knowledge bases that underpinned intelligent
systems decades ago, CEDAR templates capture the knowledge in symbolic form,
and they allow that knowledge to be applied in a variety of settings. They
provide a mechanism for scientific communities to create shared metadata
standards and to encode their preferences for the application of those
standards, and for deploying those standards in a range of intelligent systems
to promote open science.
