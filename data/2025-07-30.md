### [1] [Image deidentification in the XNAT ecosystem: use cases and solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20657)
*Alex Michie,Simon J Doran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XNAT 配合外部工具实现 DICOM 数据去标识化，MIDI-B 挑战赛中分数从 97.91% 提升至 99.61%。规则方法可移除姓名信息但地址信息处理有待改进。机器学习模型在地址移除方面有潜力但需优化，以避免影响其他文本数据。最终实际去标识化失败率估计为 0.19%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为 MIDI-B 挑战赛提供一个基于 XNAT 的 DICOM 数据去标识化解决方案，并展示该方法在处理姓名、地址等敏感信息方面的能力和局限性。

Method: 使用 XNAT 及其生态系统中的独立工具，详细介绍了一个用于 DICOM 数据去标识化的工作流程。将不同的去标识化需求场景化，并利用 XNAT 的内置功能和外部工具来实现。该方法在 MIDI-B 挑战赛的验证阶段进行了适应性调整，并在测试阶段取得了初步结果。

Result: 在 MIDI-B 测试阶段，初始得分为 97.91%，由于与 Synapse 平台的晦气技术不兼容，阻碍了验证阶段的反馈。通过额外的差异报告，分数显著提高到 99.61%。基于规则的方法能够移除所有姓名信息，但地址信息处理不完全。机器学习模型在地址移除方面部分成功，但对其他自由文本数据过于激进，导致整体性能下降至 99.54%。

Conclusion: XNAT 的规则方法能够移除测试语料库中所有与姓名相关的信息，但在处理地址数据时存在不足。使用机器学习模型移除地址的初步实验部分成功，但其他类型的自由文本数据模型表现过于激进，导致整体性能略有下降。未来的工作将集中于改进地址识别能力以及移除图像像素中烧录的可识别数据。尽管与组织者就“答案的关键”的技术问题仍在讨论中，但我们估计在 MIDI-B 测试语料库中，我们实际的去标识化失败率约为 0.19%。

Abstract: XNAT is a server-based data management platform widely used in academia for
curating large databases of DICOM images for research projects. We describe in
detail a deidentification workflow for DICOM data using facilities in XNAT,
together with independent tools in the XNAT "ecosystem". We list different
contexts in which deidentification might be needed, based on our prior
experience. The starting point for participation in the Medical Image
De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B) challenge was a set of pre-existing local
methodologies, which were adapted during the validation phase of the challenge.
Our result in the test phase was 97.91\%, considerably lower than our peers,
due largely to an arcane technical incompatibility of our methodology with the
challenge's Synapse platform, which prevented us receiving feedback during the
validation phase. Post-submission, additional discrepancy reports from the
organisers and via the MIDI-B Continuous Benchmarking facility, enabled us to
improve this score significantly to 99.61\%. An entirely rule-based approach
was shown to be capable of removing all name-related information in the test
corpus, but exhibited failures in dealing fully with address data. Initial
experiments using published machine-learning models to remove addresses were
partially successful but showed the models to be "over-aggressive" on other
types of free-text data, leading to a slight overall degradation in performance
to 99.54\%. Future development will therefore focus on improving
address-recognition capabilities, but also on better removal of identifiable
data burned into the image pixels. Several technical aspects relating to the
"answer key" are still under discussion with the challenge organisers, but we
estimate that our percentage of genuine deidentification failures on the MIDI-B
test corpus currently stands at 0.19\%. (Abridged from original for arXiv

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了评估和增强VLMs在电子表格理解能力的方法，发现了VLMs在OCR方面有潜力但空间和格式理解能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了全面评估VLMs在电子表格理解方面的能力，并为未来增强VLMs的电子表格数据理解能力提供方向。

Method: 提出三个自监督挑战及相应的评估指标，以全面评估VLMs的光学字符识别（OCR）、空间感知和视觉格式识别能力。此外，利用电子表格表格检测任务来评估VLMs的整体性能。为了更精细地探测VLMs，我们提出了三种电子表格到图像的设置：列宽调整、样式更改和地址增强。我们提出了提示的变体来处理不同设置下的上述任务。值得注意的是，为了利用VLMs在理解文本而非二维定位方面的优势，我们建议在电子表格边界检测中解码表格四个边界的单元格值。

Result: VLMs在电子表格理解方面展现出有希望的光学字符识别（OCR）能力，但在单元格遗漏和不对齐方面表现不佳，并且在空间和格式识别能力方面存在明显不足。

Conclusion: VLMs在电子表格理解方面展现出有希望的光学字符识别（OCR）能力，但在单元格遗漏和不对齐方面表现不佳，并且在空间和格式识别能力方面存在明显不足，这表明未来的工作需要利用我们提出的方法来增强VLMs的电子表格数据理解能力，通过在各种设置下生成大量的电子表格-图像对。

Abstract: This paper explores capabilities of Vision Language Models on spreadsheet
comprehension. We propose three self-supervised challenges with corresponding
evaluation metrics to comprehensively evaluate VLMs on Optical Character
Recognition (OCR), spatial perception, and visual format recognition.
Additionally, we utilize the spreadsheet table detection task to assess the
overall performance of VLMs by integrating these challenges. To probe VLMs more
finely, we propose three spreadsheet-to-image settings: column width
adjustment, style change, and address augmentation. We propose variants of
prompts to address the above tasks in different settings. Notably, to leverage
the strengths of VLMs in understanding text rather than two-dimensional
positioning, we propose to decode cell values on the four boundaries of the
table in spreadsheet boundary detection. Our findings reveal that VLMs
demonstrate promising OCR capabilities but produce unsatisfactory results due
to cell omission and misalignment, and they notably exhibit insufficient
spatial and format recognition skills, motivating future work to enhance VLMs'
spreadsheet data comprehension capabilities using our methods to generate
extensive spreadsheet-image pairs in various settings.

### [3] [High-Throughput Phenotyping using Computer Vision and Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06354)
*Vivaan Singhvi,Langalibalele Lunga,Pragya Nidhi,Chris Keum,Varrun Prakash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究利用 OCR、图像分割和机器学习技术分析了 1,672 张杨树图像，以提取表型信息并预测处理类型。研究实现了较高的标签读取准确率 (94.31%)，但形态学分类和处理预测的准确率分别为 62.82% 和 60.08%。EXIF 标签的缺失信息限制了对叶片大小和表型相关性的进一步分析，但为未来研究提供了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高通量表型分析旨在提高植物表型评估的效率和准确性，尤其是在处理大型数据集和提取特定性状方面。尽管已有一些研究尝试使用深度神经网络和自动相机来解决这些挑战，但现有数据集常常缺乏物理标签，限制了信息提取的精度和下游分析。本研究旨在通过集成 OCR、图像分割和机器学习技术，并利用包含详细标签的数据集，来克服这些限制，从而实现更精确的植物表型信息提取和分析。

Method: 本研究利用包含 1,672 张杨树（Populus Trichocarpa）图像的数据集，其中包含显示处理（对照或干旱）、块、行、位置和基因型的白色标签。研究采用了光学字符识别（OCR）技术来读取植物标签，结合图像分割技术和机器学习算法进行形态学分类，并利用机器学习模型根据这些分类预测处理类型。此外，还分析了编码的 EXIF 标签，以确定叶片大小和表型之间的相关性。

Result: OCR 模型在非空文本提取方面达到了 94.31% 的准确率，能够准确地将信息录入电子表格。形态学分类模型（识别叶片形状、颜色和褐斑程度）的平均准确率为 62.82%，预测植物处理的准确率为 60.08%。研究发现 EXIF 标签缺失关键信息，阻碍了叶片大小的评估以及表型与条件之间相关性的分析。

Conclusion: 该研究表明，结合 OCR、图像分割和机器学习的方法可以有效地从植物图像中提取表型信息，并预测植物处理（对照或干旱）。虽然在识别叶片形状、颜色和褐斑程度等表型方面取得了 62.82% 的平均准确率，以及 60.08% 的植物处理预测准确率，但 EXIF 标签的缺失信息阻碍了叶片大小和表型之间相关性的评估。未来的研究可以改进这些方面，以实现对这些特征的更全面评估。

Abstract: High-throughput phenotyping refers to the non-destructive and efficient
evaluation of plant phenotypes. In recent years, it has been coupled with
machine learning in order to improve the process of phenotyping plants by
increasing efficiency in handling large datasets and developing methods for the
extraction of specific traits. Previous studies have developed methods to
advance these challenges through the application of deep neural networks in
tandem with automated cameras; however, the datasets being studied often
excluded physical labels. In this study, we used a dataset provided by Oak
Ridge National Laboratory with 1,672 images of Populus Trichocarpa with white
labels displaying treatment (control or drought), block, row, position, and
genotype. Optical character recognition (OCR) was used to read these labels on
the plants, image segmentation techniques in conjunction with machine learning
algorithms were used for morphological classifications, machine learning models
were used to predict treatment based on those classifications, and analyzed
encoded EXIF tags were used for the purpose of finding leaf size and
correlations between phenotypes. We found that our OCR model had an accuracy of
94.31% for non-null text extractions, allowing for the information to be
accurately placed in a spreadsheet. Our classification models identified leaf
shape, color, and level of brown splotches with an average accuracy of 62.82%,
and plant treatment with an accuracy of 60.08%. Finally, we identified a few
crucial pieces of information absent from the EXIF tags that prevented the
assessment of the leaf size. There was also missing information that prevented
the assessment of correlations between phenotypes and conditions. However,
future studies could improve upon this to allow for the assessment of these
features.

### [4] [Socratic Models: Composing Zero-Shot Multimodal Reasoning with Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00598)
*Andy Zeng,Maria Attarian,Brian Ichter,Krzysztof Choromanski,Adrian Wong,Stefan Welker,Federico Tombari,Aveek Purohit,Michael Ryoo,Vikas Sindhwani,Johnny Lee,Vincent Vanhoucke,Pete Florence*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Socratic Models (SMs) combine different pretrained models without finetuning to create new multimodal capabilities, outperforming existing methods and enabling novel applications in egocentric video analysis, assistive dialogue, and robot applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging the diverse commonsense knowledge stored in different pretrained models (e.g., visual-language models vs. language models) which are trained on different data domains.

Method: Socratic Models (SMs) is a framework where multiple pretrained models are composed zero-shot via multimodal-informed prompting to exchange information and capture new multimodal capabilities without finetuning.

Result: SMs are competitive with state-of-the-art zero-shot image captioning and video-to-text retrieval, and enable new applications like egocentric video QA, multimodal assistive dialogue, and robot perception and planning.

Conclusion: Socratic Models (SMs) are a modular framework that leverages the diversity of pretrained models to achieve new multimodal capabilities without finetuning. SMs enable new applications such as egocentric video question answering, multimodal assistive dialogue, and robot perception and planning.

Abstract: Large pretrained (e.g., "foundation") models exhibit distinct capabilities
depending on the domain of data they are trained on. While these domains are
generic, they may only barely overlap. For example, visual-language models
(VLMs) are trained on Internet-scale image captions, but large language models
(LMs) are further trained on Internet-scale text with no images (e.g.,
spreadsheets, SAT questions, code). As a result, these models store different
forms of commonsense knowledge across different domains. In this work, we show
that this diversity is symbiotic, and can be leveraged through Socratic Models
(SMs): a modular framework in which multiple pretrained models may be composed
zero-shot i.e., via multimodal-informed prompting, to exchange information with
each other and capture new multimodal capabilities, without requiring
finetuning. With minimal engineering, SMs are not only competitive with
state-of-the-art zero-shot image captioning and video-to-text retrieval, but
also enable new applications such as (i) answering free-form questions about
egocentric video, (ii) engaging in multimodal assistive dialogue with people
(e.g., for cooking recipes) by interfacing with external APIs and databases
(e.g., web search), and (iii) robot perception and planning.

### [5] [TableParser: Automatic Table Parsing with Weak Supervision from Spreadsheets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01654)
*Susie Xi Rao,Johannes Rausch,Peter Egger,Ce Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new system, TableParser, precisely extracts data from tables in PDFs and scanned images using domain adaptation. It also includes annotation tools (TableAnnotator, ExcelAnnotator) for weak supervision, with all resources shared for research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting data from various table formats like PDFs, images, spreadsheets, and CSVs is crucial for many applications. The paper aims to provide a precise and efficient solution for parsing table structures and extracting content.

Method: The paper devises a system called TableParser for parsing tables in native PDFs and scanned images. It also creates TableAnnotator and ExcelAnnotator, which form a spreadsheet-based weak supervision mechanism and a pipeline to enable table parsing. The efficacy of domain adaptation is shown through extensive experiments.

Result: The paper shows the efficacy of domain adaptation in developing a high-precision table parsing tool (TableParser) for native PDFs and scanned images. The created resources (TableAnnotator and ExcelAnnotator) facilitate table parsing through weak supervision.

Conclusion: The paper presents TableParser, a system for parsing tables in native PDFs and scanned images, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain adaptation. It also introduces TableAnnotator and ExcelAnnotator for weak supervision, sharing these resources to aid further research.

Abstract: Tables have been an ever-existing structure to store data. There exist now
different approaches to store tabular data physically. PDFs, images,
spreadsheets, and CSVs are leading examples. Being able to parse table
structures and extract content bounded by these structures is of high
importance in many applications. In this paper, we devise TableParser, a system
capable of parsing tables in both native PDFs and scanned images with high
precision. We have conducted extensive experiments to show the efficacy of
domain adaptation in developing such a tool. Moreover, we create TableAnnotator
and ExcelAnnotator, which constitute a spreadsheet-based weak supervision
mechanism and a pipeline to enable table parsing. We share these resources with
the research community to facilitate further research in this interesting
direction.

### [6] [An Empirical Study of Validating Synthetic Data for Formula Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10657)
*Usneek Singh,José Cambronero,Sumit Gulwani,Aditya Kanade,Anirudh Khatry,Vu Le,Mukul Singh,Gust Verbruggen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 验证LLM生成的电子表格公式的自然语言描述可以提高模型性能并增加其解决问题的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在电子表格公式任务上的资源稀缺，影响了预训练模型的性能和微调能力。需要验证LLM生成的自然语言描述的准确性，以确保其对微调有益。

Method: 使用代理目标来评估合成标注的准确性，并提供实证结果。

Result: 验证可以提高在四种模型（2个开放权重和2个封闭权重）上的性能，并且增加模型解决问题的复杂性。

Conclusion: 验证合成的自然语言描述可以提高模型在电子表格公式任务上的性能，并且尽管验证会 pruning 掉更具挑战性的例子，但它会增加模型在经过验证的数据微调后可以解决的问题的复杂性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to help with writing formulas
in spreadsheets, but resources on these formulas are scarce, impacting both the
base performance of pre-trained models and limiting the ability to fine-tune
them. Given a corpus of formulas, we can use a(nother) model to generate
synthetic natural language utterances for fine-tuning. However, it is important
to validate whether the NL generated by the LLM is indeed accurate to be
beneficial for fine-tuning. In this paper, we provide empirical results on the
impact of validating these synthetic training examples with surrogate
objectives that evaluate the accuracy of the synthetic annotations. We
demonstrate that validation improves performance over raw data across four
models (2 open and 2 closed weight). Interestingly, we show that although
validation tends to prune more challenging examples, it increases the
complexity of problems that models can solve after being fine-tuned on
validated data.

### [7] [General Table Question Answering via Answer-Formula Joint Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12345)
*Zhongyuan Wang,Richong Zhang,Zhijie Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的表格问答方法，使用电子表格公式作为可执行表示，并引入了一个名为 TabAF 的通用框架，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型语言模型（LLMs）在表格问答（TableQA）任务中表现出色，能够生成答案文本、SQL 查询、Python 代码或自定义操作，但缺乏处理特定问题类型或表格结构的多功能性。表格作为一种广泛使用且定义明确的表格数据操作语言，尚未得到充分探索以解决 TableQA 问题。

Method: 本文构建了一个名为 FormulaQA 的大型公式标注表格问答数据集，并提出了 TabAF 通用表格问答框架。TabAF 使用单个 LLM 骨干网络来解码答案和公式，并证明了其在处理不同结构表格和特定类型问题上的多功能性。

Result: TabAF 在 WikiTableQuestion、HiTab 和 TabFact 数据集上取得了新的最先进性能，证明了其处理表格问答任务的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为 TabAF 的通用表格问答框架，能够同时处理多种类型的表格和问答任务。与现有方法不同，TabAF 使用单个 LLM 骨干网络来解码答案和公式，展现了出色的通用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Advanced table question answering (TableQA) methods prompt large language
models (LLMs) to generate answer text, SQL query, Python code, or custom
operations, which impressively improve the complex reasoning problems in the
TableQA task. However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific
question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the
widely used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been
thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use
the Formula as the executable representation for solving complex reasoning on
tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct
\texttt{FromulaQA}, a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset from existing
datasets. In addition, we propose \texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering
framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables
simultaneously. Unlike existing methods, \texttt{TabAF} decodes answers and
Formulas with a single LLM backbone, demonstrating great versatility and
generalization. \texttt{TabAF} based on Llama3.1-70B achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTableQuestion, HiTab, and TabFact.

TL;DR: TableLLM是一个80亿参数的大型语言模型，专门用于处理表格数据，通过远程监督训练，并在公开的基准测试中证明了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决真实办公场景中，文档或电子表格中表格数据处理的挑战，提出TableLLM。

Method: 提出了一种远程监督训练方法，包括用于增强LLM推理能力和确保自动生成数据质量的推理过程扩展策略和交叉验证策略。

Result: TableLLM在针对文档和电子表格格式定制的基准测试中，表现出优于现有模型的优势。

Conclusion: TableLLM在处理文档和电子表格中的表格数据操作任务方面表现出色，优于现有的通用和专注于表格数据的LLM。

Abstract: We introduce TableLLM, a robust large language model (LLM) with 8 billion
parameters, purpose-built for proficiently handling tabular data manipulation
tasks, whether they are embedded within documents or spreadsheets, catering to
real-world office scenarios. We propose a distant supervision method for
training, which comprises a reasoning process extension strategy, aiding in
training LLMs to understand reasoning patterns more effectively as well as a
cross-way validation strategy, ensuring the quality of the automatically
generated data. To evaluate the performance of TableLLM, we have crafted
benchmarks tailored to address both document and spreadsheet formats as well as
constructed a well-organized evaluation pipeline capable of handling both
scenarios. Thorough evaluations underscore the advantages of TableLLM when
compared to various existing general-purpose and tabular data-focused LLMs. We
have publicly released the model checkpoint, source code, benchmarks, and a web
application for user interaction. Our codes and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/TableLLM/TableLLM.

*Volker Emmrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GiesKaNe项目是一个参考、历史和句法注释树库，旨在通过结合人工和机器的方法来编译语料库，并提出了一种新的文本分类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本文探讨了GiesKaNe项目（吉森-卡塞尔大学，现代德语句法基本结构）的语料库编译要求。该项目具有三个中心特征：它是一个参考语料库、一个历史语料库和一个句法深度注释的树库。作为历史语料库，GiesKaNe旨在与历史和当代语料库建立联系，确保其在时间与语言背景中的相关性。

Method: 文章讨论了分词、规范化、句子定义、标记、解析和注释员之间的一致性等基础主题，以及对语法模型、注释模式和已建立的公认注释标准之间的比较以及人类和机器协作的整合等高级考虑因素。此外，还提出了一种通过机器辅助对文本进行概念口语和书面语连续分类的新方法，并提出了一种从现有注释中推导出公认标准注释的方法。

Result: GiesKaNe项目旨在建立一个连接历史和当代语料库的参考语料库、历史语料库和句法深度注释树库。通过结合人工和机器的专业知识，该项目管理着复杂的编译过程，解决了从分词到注释模式等一系列挑战。

Conclusion: 该项目的工作流程表明，像GiesKaNe这样雄心勃勃的项目可以有效地实施，而无需专门的注释工具，而是可以基于对简单电子表格的战略使用，并整合现有基础设施的功能。

Abstract: This article explores the requirements for corpus compilation within the
GiesKaNe project (University of Giessen and Kassel, Syntactic Basic Structures
of New High German). The project is defined by three central characteristics:
it is a reference corpus, a historical corpus, and a syntactically deeply
annotated treebank. As a historical corpus, GiesKaNe aims to establish
connections with both historical and contemporary corpora, ensuring its
relevance across temporal and linguistic contexts. The compilation process
strikes the balance between innovation and adherence to standards, addressing
both internal project goals and the broader interests of the research
community. The methodological complexity of such a project is managed through a
complementary interplay of human expertise and machine-assisted processes. The
article discusses foundational topics such as tokenization, normalization,
sentence definition, tagging, parsing, and inter-annotator agreement, alongside
advanced considerations. These include comparisons between grammatical models,
annotation schemas, and established de facto annotation standards as well as
the integration of human and machine collaboration. Notably, a novel method for
machine-assisted classification of texts along the continuum of conceptual
orality and literacy is proposed, offering new perspectives on text selection.
Furthermore, the article introduces an approach to deriving de facto standard
annotations from existing ones, mediating between standardization and
innovation. In the course of describing the workflow the article demonstrates
that even ambitious projects like GiesKaNe can be effectively implemented using
existing research infrastructure, requiring no specialized annotation tools.
Instead, it is shown that the workflow can be based on the strategic use of a
simple spreadsheet and integrates the capabilities of the existing
infrastructure.

### [10] [MiMoTable: A Multi-scale Spreadsheet Benchmark with Meta Operations for Table Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11711)
*Zheng Li,Yang Du,Mao Zheng,Mingyang Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiMoTable是一个包含真实世界电子表格和新难度评估标准的新基准，旨在改进LLM的表格推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补现有表格推理基准与真实世界表格和问题之间存在的差距。

Method: 提出了一种名为MiMoTable的多尺度电子表格基准测试，包含真实世界的电子表格和包含六种元操作的难度评估标准。

Result: MiMoTable包含七个领域、不同类型的真实世界电子表格，并提出了衡量问题难度的六类元操作新标准。实验表明Claude-3.5-Sonnet准确率为77.4%，且LLM在难度更高的基准测试上表现下降。

Conclusion: LLMs在MiMoTable上的表现仍有很大提升空间，Claude-3.5-Sonnet达到最佳准确率77.4%。新提出的评估标准能有效衡量基准测试的难度，且LLM在该标准下难度越高表现越差。

Abstract: Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capability of Large
Language Models (LLMs) for table reasoning and has significantly improved the
performance on existing benchmarks. However, tables and user questions in
real-world applications are more complex and diverse, presenting an unignorable
gap compared to the existing benchmarks. To fill the gap, we propose a
\textbf{M}ult\textbf{i}-scale spreadsheet benchmark with \textbf{M}eta
\textbf{o}perations for \textbf{Table} reasoning, named as MiMoTable.
Specifically, MiMoTable incorporates two key features. First, the tables in
MiMoTable are all spreadsheets used in real-world scenarios, which cover seven
domains and contain different types. Second, we define a new criterion with six
categories of meta operations for measuring the difficulty of each question in
MiMoTable, simultaneously as a new perspective for measuring the difficulty of
the existing benchmarks. Experimental results show that Claude-3.5-Sonnet
achieves the best performance with 77.4\% accuracy, indicating that there is
still significant room to improve for LLMs on MiMoTable. Furthermore, we grade
the difficulty of existing benchmarks according to our new criteria.
Experiments have shown that the performance of LLMs decreases as the difficulty
of benchmarks increases, thereby proving the effectiveness of our proposed new
criterion.

TL;DR: SpreadsheetBench是一个包含真实世界Excel问题和数据的基准测试，用于评估LLM在电子表格处理方面的能力。现有模型表现远不如人类，表明该领域仍有很大提升空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在为大语言模型（LLMs）提供一个更贴近真实电子表格用户工作流程的基准测试，以克服现有基准测试依赖合成查询和简化文件的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种名为SpreadsheetBench的新型基准测试，该基准测试包含912个来自在线Excel论坛的真实用户问题和相关电子表格数据，并设计了一种类似在线判题平台的评估指标，使用多个电子表格文件作为测试用例来评估模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 在单轮和多轮推理设置下对多种LLM进行的评估显示，即使是SOTA模型在处理SpreadsheetBench基准测试时，与人类表现相比仍存在巨大差距，证明了该基准测试的挑战性。

Conclusion: 现有的LLM在处理真实世界电子表格任务方面与人类水平存在显著差距，该基准测试突显了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce SpreadsheetBench, a challenging spreadsheet manipulation
benchmark exclusively derived from real-world scenarios, designed to immerse
current large language models (LLMs) in the actual workflow of spreadsheet
users. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on synthesized queries and
simplified spreadsheet files, SpreadsheetBench is built from 912 real questions
gathered from online Excel forums, which reflect the intricate needs of users.
The associated spreadsheets from the forums contain a variety of tabular data
such as multiple tables, non-standard relational tables, and abundant
non-textual elements. Furthermore, we propose a more reliable evaluation metric
akin to online judge platforms, where multiple spreadsheet files are created as
test cases for each instruction, ensuring the evaluation of robust solutions
capable of handling spreadsheets with varying values. Our comprehensive
evaluation of various LLMs under both single-round and multi-round inference
settings reveals a substantial gap between the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models
and human performance, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty.

Abstract: Writing formulas on spreadsheets, such as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets,
is a widespread practice among users performing data analysis. However,
crafting formulas on spreadsheets remains a tedious and error-prone task for
many end-users, particularly when dealing with complex operations. To alleviate
the burden associated with writing spreadsheet formulas, this paper introduces
a novel benchmark task called NL2Formula, with the aim to generate executable
formulas that are grounded on a spreadsheet table, given a Natural Language
(NL) query as input. To accomplish this, we construct a comprehensive dataset
consisting of 70,799 paired NL queries and corresponding spreadsheet formulas,
covering 21,670 tables and 37 types of formula functions. We realize the
NL2Formula task by providing a sequence-to-sequence baseline implementation
called fCoder. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of fCoder,
demonstrating its superior performance compared to the baseline models.
Furthermore, we also compare fCoder with an initial GPT-3.5 model (i.e.,
text-davinci-003). Lastly, through in-depth error analysis, we identify
potential challenges in the NL2Formula task and advocate for further
investigation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark, InstructExcel, was created to test LLMs' ability to generate Excel code from natural language. GPT-4 performs better than GPT-3.5, and improvements were seen with more examples and dynamic prompting, but it remains a challenging task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigated whether LLMs can generate code (Excel OfficeScripts) that solves Excel-specific tasks provided via natural language user instructions.

Method: Introduced a new large-scale benchmark, InstructExcel, by leveraging Excel's 'Automate' feature to automatically generate OfficeScripts from user actions. The benchmark includes over 10k samples covering 170+ Excel operations across 2,000 publicly available Excel spreadsheets.

Result: Experiments in zero-shot and few-shot settings showed that InstructExcel is a challenging benchmark for GPT-4. Performance improved with GPT-4 over GPT-3.5, more in-context examples, and dynamic prompting.

Conclusion: LLMs can generate code for Excel tasks, but state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 still struggle with this benchmark, indicating a need for further research and development.

Abstract: With the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) we can solve increasingly
more complex NLP tasks across various domains, including spreadsheets. This
work investigates whether LLMs can generate code (Excel OfficeScripts, a
TypeScript API for executing many tasks in Excel) that solves Excel specific
tasks provided via natural language user instructions. To do so we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark, InstructExcel, created by leveraging the 'Automate'
feature in Excel to automatically generate OfficeScripts from users' actions.
Our benchmark includes over 10k samples covering 170+ Excel operations across
2,000 publicly available Excel spreadsheets. Experiments across various
zero-shot and few-shot settings show that InstructExcel is a hard benchmark for
state of the art models like GPT-4. We observe that (1) using GPT-4 over
GPT-3.5, (2) providing more in-context examples, and (3) dynamic prompting can
help improve performance on this benchmark.

TL;DR: 在表格语言模型中，通过具有内置多样性的细胞级采集函数可以减少标注成本，但强制表多样性会产生负面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在表格语言模型研究取得进展的背景下，现实世界的应用仍然面临挑战，主要在于获取大量标签成本高昂，因为只有专家才能标注技术性强、领域特定的表格。主动学习有望降低标注成本，但目前尚未有将主动学习与表格语言模型相结合的研究。

Method: 研究了在真实世界的工业表格语言模型用例中，用于亚单元格命名实体识别的不同采集函数。

Result: 细胞级采集函数内置多样性可显著降低标注工作量，而强制表多样性则适得其反。此外，计算效率和人类标注者的视角等方面仍存在一些根本性问题有待解决。

Conclusion: 细胞级采集函数内置多样性可显著降低标注工作量，而强制表多样性则适得其反。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in tabular language model research, real-world
applications are still challenging. In industry, there is an abundance of
tables found in spreadsheets, but acquisition of substantial amounts of labels
is expensive, since only experts can annotate the often highly technical and
domain-specific tables. Active learning could potentially reduce labeling
costs, however, so far there are no works related to active learning in
conjunction with tabular language models. In this paper we investigate
different acquisition functions in a real-world industrial tabular language
model use case for sub-cell named entity recognition. Our results show that
cell-level acquisition functions with built-in diversity can significantly
reduce the labeling effort, while enforced table diversity is detrimental. We
further see open fundamental questions concerning computational efficiency and
the perspective of human annotators.

TL;DR: TABT5 是一个 encoder-decoder 模型，在表格理解任务中取得了新的 state-of-the-art 结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的 encoder-only transformer 模型在表格理解任务中受到限制，主要用于类似分类的任务。

Method: TABT5 是一个 encoder-decoder 模型，它通过结合解码器组件、使用特定于表的嵌入和预训练来克服 encoder-only 架构的限制。

Result: TABT5 在电子表格公式预测方面提高了 15% 的序列准确率，在问答方面提高了 2.5% 的序列准确率，在数据到文本生成方面提高了 2.5% 的 BLEU 分数。

Conclusion: TABT5 实现了在电子表格公式预测、问答和数据到文本生成等多个领域的新 state-of-the-art 结果。

Abstract: Encoder-only transformer models have been successfully applied to different
table understanding tasks, as in TAPAS (Herzig et al., 2020). A major
limitation of these architectures is that they are constrained to
classification-like tasks such as cell selection or entailment detection. We
present TABT5, an encoder-decoder model that generates natural language text
based on tables and textual inputs. TABT5 overcomes the encoder-only limitation
by incorporating a decoder component and leverages the input structure with
table specific embeddings and pre-training. TABT5 achieves new state-of-the-art
results on several domains, including spreadsheet formula prediction with a 15%
increase in sequence accuracy, QA with a 2.5% increase in sequence accuracy and
data-to-text generation with a 2.5% increase in BLEU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着网络上表格数据的激增，表格预训练框架得到了广泛研究，并在表格问答、类型识别、关系分类、搜索和公式预测等任务上取得了显著成果。为了充分利用无标签表格中的监督信号，研究者们设计了多种预训练目标，如单元格去噪、数值关系预测和SQL执行等。同时，为了更好地利用表格的（半）结构化特性，研究者们探索了多种表格语言模型，特别是带有特殊设计注意力机制的模型。由于表格通常与自由格式文本一起出现和交互，表格预训练通常采用表格-文本联合预训练的形式，这引起了多个领域的研究兴趣。

Method: 对表格预训练模型设计、预训练目标和下游任务进行了回顾和分析。

Result: 表格预训练框架在各种任务上取得了新的技术水平。

Conclusion: 本文对表格预训练进行了全面的回顾，涵盖了模型设计、预训练目标和下游任务，并对现有挑战和未来机遇进行了展望。

Abstract: Since a vast number of tables can be easily collected from web pages,
spreadsheets, PDFs, and various other document types, a flurry of table
pre-training frameworks have been proposed following the success of text and
images, and they have achieved new state-of-the-arts on various tasks such as
table question answering, table type recognition, column relation
classification, table search, formula prediction, etc. To fully use the
supervision signals in unlabeled tables, a variety of pre-training objectives
have been designed and evaluated, for example, denoising cell values,
predicting numerical relationships, and implicitly executing SQLs. And to best
leverage the characteristics of (semi-)structured tables, various tabular
language models, particularly with specially-designed attention mechanisms,
have been explored. Since tables usually appear and interact with free-form
text, table pre-training usually takes the form of table-text joint
pre-training, which attracts significant research interests from multiple
domains. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of different model
designs, pre-training objectives, and downstream tasks for table pre-training,
and we further share our thoughts and vision on existing challenges and future
opportunities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableQuery queries large tables using text-based AI models, avoiding memory issues and database serialization problems of older methods. It's flexible and uses readily available technology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for tabular data question answering struggle with large, real-world datasets that may exceed memory capacity or are stored in frequently updated live databases. TableQuery aims to overcome these practical limitations.

Method: TableQuery employs deep learning models pre-trained for question answering on free text to translate natural language queries into executable structured queries. This approach bypasses the requirement of fitting large datasets into memory or serializing databases.

Result: TableQuery enables efficient querying of large or live tabular datasets by converting natural language questions into structured queries, leveraging readily available pre-trained language models without the need for retraining and allowing for easy model upgrades.

Conclusion: TableQuery uses pre-trained deep learning models for question answering on free text to convert natural language queries into structured queries, effectively addressing limitations of existing methods by avoiding the need to load entire tables into memory or serialize databases.

Abstract: This paper presents TableQuery, a novel tool for querying tabular data using
deep learning models pre-trained to answer questions on free text. Existing
deep learning methods for question answering on tabular data have various
limitations, such as having to feed the entire table as input into a neural
network model, making them unsuitable for most real-world applications. Since
real-world data might contain millions of rows, it may not entirely fit into
the memory. Moreover, data could be stored in live databases, which are updated
in real-time, and it is impractical to serialize an entire database to a neural
network-friendly format each time it is updated. In TableQuery, we use deep
learning models pre-trained for question answering on free text to convert
natural language queries to structured queries, which can be run against a
database or a spreadsheet. This method eliminates the need for fitting the
entire data into memory as well as serializing databases. Furthermore, deep
learning models pre-trained for question answering on free text are readily
available on platforms such as HuggingFace Model Hub (7). TableQuery does not
require re-training; when a newly trained model for question answering with
better performance is available, it can replace the existing model in
TableQuery.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有计算机辅助翻译（CAT）工具的设计选择（如逐句呈现和并排视图）对译者绩效（速度和准确性）的影响，为改进 CAT 工具的设计提供依据。

Method: 通过在三个实验性文本处理任务中测量速度和准确性，对计算机辅助翻译（CAT）工具的设计选择（如逐句呈现和顶部/底部排列）进行了受控评估。

Result: 与未分段文本相比，逐句呈现可提高文本复制速度和句内错误识别能力；与并排显示相比，顶部/底部排列可提高文本复制速度。然而，在修订方面，未分段文本在准确性和时间效率方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 现有广泛使用的计算机辅助翻译（CAT）工具将文档分割成句子等段落，并以类似电子表格的视图并排显示。本研究首次对这些设计选择对译者绩效的影响进行了受控评估，衡量了三个实验性文本处理任务的速度和准确性。结果表明，与未分段文本相比，逐句呈现可实现更快的文本复制和句内错误识别；与并排显示相比，源语言和目标语言句子在顶部和底部的排列可实现更快的文本复制。然而，在修订方面，研究结果表明，呈现未分段文本可实现最高的准确性和时间效率。本研究结果对设计 CAT 工具的最佳实践有直接指导意义。

Abstract: Widely used computer-aided translation (CAT) tools divide documents into
segments such as sentences and arrange them in a side-by-side, spreadsheet-like
view. We present the first controlled evaluation of these design choices on
translator performance, measuring speed and accuracy in three experimental text
processing tasks. We find significant evidence that sentence-by-sentence
presentation enables faster text reproduction and within-sentence error
identification compared to unsegmented text, and that a top-and-bottom
arrangement of source and target sentences enables faster text reproduction
compared to a side-by-side arrangement. For revision, on the other hand, our
results suggest that presenting unsegmented text results in the highest
accuracy and time efficiency. Our findings have direct implications for best
practices in designing CAT tools.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: ACADL can model AI hardware accelerators and simulate DNN performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the challenge faced by manufacturers of AI-integrated products in selecting the most suitable AI hardware accelerator by providing a more efficient and accurate method for comparing different accelerator design alternatives, moving beyond reliance on data sheets, spreadsheets, or slow black-box simulators.

Method: The paper uses the Abstract Computer Architecture Description Language (ACADL) to model AI hardware accelerators, map Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) onto these models, and utilizes timing simulation semantics to collect performance data.

Result: The result is a demonstrated methodology for using ACADL to model AI hardware accelerators and simulate their performance with DNNs, offering engineers a better understanding of performance characteristics compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates the use of ACADL for modeling AI hardware accelerators, mapping DNNs onto them, and simulating performance, providing a more efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed remarkable growth, particularly
through the proliferation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). These powerful models
drive technological advancements across various domains. However, to harness
their potential in real-world applications, specialized hardware accelerators
are essential. This demand has sparked a market for parameterizable AI hardware
accelerators offered by different vendors.
  Manufacturers of AI-integrated products face a critical challenge: selecting
an accelerator that aligns with their product's performance requirements. The
decision involves choosing the right hardware and configuring a suitable set of
parameters. However, comparing different accelerator design alternatives
remains a complex task. Often, engineers rely on data sheets, spreadsheet
calculations, or slow black-box simulators, which only offer a coarse
understanding of the performance characteristics.
  The Abstract Computer Architecture Description Language (ACADL) is a concise
formalization of computer architecture block diagrams, which helps to
communicate computer architecture on different abstraction levels and allows
for inferring performance characteristics. In this paper, we demonstrate how to
use the ACADL to model AI hardware accelerators, use their ACADL description to
map DNNs onto them, and explain the timing simulation semantics to gather
performance results.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种通过在线监控和自动替换模型来加速复杂系统仿真的方法，在缓存仿真中证明了其有效性，显著减少了计算量并保持了高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着系统和应用的复杂性增加，详细仿真耗时过长，迫使架构师在需要快速迭代设计时使用电子表格等简单模型，但从简单仿真迁移到详细仿真过程复杂且成本高昂，并且架构师常常依赖直觉选择简单模型。

Method: 通过在线监控仿真行为，并自动将详细模型替换为更简单的统计模型，处理了时间相关的统计数据和下游的副作用。

Result: 在SVE-Cachesim中实现的该方法，在近似L1D缓存模型时，仿真周期计数误差仅为8%，同时使用了90%以上的近似缓存模型，并且更简单的模型每次“执行”所需的计算量减少了2到8倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过在线监控仿真行为并自动用更简单的统计模型替换详细模型，成功地在简单和详细仿真之间架起了桥梁，同时实现了高精度和计算效率。

Abstract: As systems and applications grow more complex, detailed simulation takes an
ever increasing amount of time. The prospect of increased simulation time
resulting in slower design iteration forces architects to use simpler models,
such as spreadsheets, when they want to iterate quickly on a design. However,
the task of migrating from a simple simulation to one with more detail often
requires multiple executions to find where simple models could be effective,
which could be more expensive than running the detailed model in the first
place. Also, architects must often rely on intuition to choose these simpler
models, further complicating the problem.
  In this work, we present a method of bridging the gap between simple and
detailed simulation by monitoring simulation behavior online and automatically
swapping out detailed models with simpler statistical approximations. We
demonstrate the potential of our methodology by implementing it in the
open-source simulator SVE-Cachesim to swap out the level one data cache (L1D)
within a memory hierarchy. This proof of concept demonstrates that our
technique can handle a non-trivial use-case in not just approximation of local
time-invariant statistics, but also those that vary with time (e.g., the L1D is
a form of a time-series function), and downstream side-effects (e.g., the L1D
filters accesses for the level two cache). Our simulation swaps out the
built-in cache model with only an 8% error in the simulated cycle count while
using the approximated cache models for over 90% of the simulation, and our
simpler models require two to eight times less computation per "execution" of
the model

*Qing,Xia,Advait Sarkar,Duncan P. Brumby,Anna Cox*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究发现，电子表格用户的自我效能感、声誉收益和对知识编纂难度的看法会影响其知识共享意愿。提升自我效能感和声誉收益有助于增加知识共享，而感觉知识编纂困难则会抑制知识共享。用户在日常熟练度方面自我效能感较低，但在工作场景中则较高。因此，设计电子表格时应考虑这些因素以鼓励知识分享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更好地理解个人、社会和软件相关变量如何影响电子表格知识共享意愿，从而促进终端用户程序员（end-user programmers）的专业知识获取。

Method: 通过对来自行政和财务岗位的电子表格用户（n=100）进行的调查数据进行多元回归分析，研究了个人（自我效能感）、社会（声誉收益、同事间的信任）和软件相关（编纂工作量）变量如何影响电子表格知识共享意愿。

Result: 高水平的电子表格自我效能感和认知到的声誉收益可以预测更高的知识共享意愿，而认为知识编纂费力则会降低知识共享意愿。用户普遍表示在日常电子表格熟练度方面自我效能感较低，但在工作相关场景下则表现出高自我效能感。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，提升电子表格自我效能感和认知到的声誉收益可以预测更高的知识共享意愿，而认为知识编纂费力则会降低知识共享意愿。此外，无论何种职业，用户普遍表示在日常电子表格熟练度方面自我效能感较低，但在工作相关场景下则表现出高自我效能感。这些发现提示，在设计电子表格时，应考虑和设计这些社会及个人变量，以避免有经验的用户不必要地回避分享，这对电子表格的设计具有启示意义。

Abstract: Informal Knowledge Sharing (KS) is vital for end-user programmers to gain
expertise. To better understand how personal (self-efficacy), social
(reputational gains, trust between colleagues), and software-related
(codification effort) variables influence spreadsheet KS intention, we
conducted a multiple regressions analysis based on survey data from spreadsheet
users (n=100) in administrative and finance roles. We found that high levels of
spreadsheet self-efficacy and a perception that sharing would result in
reputational gains predicted higher KS intention, but individuals who found
knowledge codification effortful showed lower KS intention. We also observed
that regardless of occupation, users tended to report a lower sense of
self-efficacy in their general spreadsheet proficiency, despite also reporting
high self-efficacy in spreadsheet use for job-related contexts. Our findings
suggest that acknowledging and designing for these social and personal
variables can help avoid situations where experienced individuals refrain
unnecessarily from sharing, with implications for spreadsheet design.

Motivation: 数据整理是数据科学项目中的关键且耗时的阶段（占项目时间的80%以上），传统的手动编码或电子表格方法存在效率低下和易出错的问题，影响下游任务的数据质量。

Method: Buckaroo是一个可视化系统，通过以下方式帮助用户进行数据整理：(1) 自动查找并推荐包含异常值的数据组以供检查；(2) 建议可用于修复异常值的整理操作；(3) 通过显示整理操作的效果并允许用户撤销或重做操作，支持用户进行可视化数据操作和迭代式数据整理。

Result: Buckaroo通过自动化异常值检测、提供操作建议和支持可视化交互，提高了数据整理的效率和准确性。

Conclusion: Buckaroo通过可视化系统突出数据差异，并通过直接操作视觉对象进行即时更正，解决了手动数据整理耗时且易出错的问题。

Abstract: Preparing datasets -- a critical phase known as data wrangling -- constitutes
the dominant phase of data science development, consuming upwards of 80% of the
total project time. This phase encompasses a myriad of tasks: parsing data,
restructuring it for analysis, repairing inaccuracies, merging sources,
eliminating duplicates, and ensuring overall data integrity. Traditional
approaches, typically through manual coding in languages such as Python or
using spreadsheets, are not only laborious but also error-prone. These issues
range from missing entries and formatting inconsistencies to data type
inaccuracies, all of which can affect the quality of downstream tasks if not
properly corrected. To address these challenges, we present Buckaroo, a
visualization system to highlight discrepancies in data and enable on-the-spot
corrections through direct manipulations of visual objects. Buckaroo (1)
automatically finds "interesting" data groups that exhibit anomalies compared
to the rest of the groups and recommends them for inspection; (2) suggests
wrangling actions that the user can choose to repair the anomalies; and (3)
allows users to visually manipulate their data by displaying the effects of
their wrangling actions and offering the ability to undo or redo these actions,
which supports the iterative nature of data wrangling. A video companion is

Conclusion: SheetMind通过多智能体分解和基于语法的执行，成功地将自然语言和电子表格功能连接起来。

Abstract: We present SheetMind, a modular multi-agent framework powered by large
language models (LLMs) for spreadsheet automation via natural language
instructions. The system comprises three specialized agents: a Manager Agent
that decomposes complex user instructions into subtasks; an Action Agent that
translates these into structured commands using a Backus Naur Form (BNF)
grammar; and a Reflection Agent that validates alignment between generated
actions and the user's original intent. Integrated into Google Sheets via a
Workspace extension, SheetMind supports real-time interaction without requiring
scripting or formula knowledge. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
an 80 percent success rate on single step tasks and approximately 70 percent on
multi step instructions, outperforming ablated and baseline variants. Our
results highlight the effectiveness of multi agent decomposition and grammar
based execution for bridging natural language and spreadsheet functionalities.

TL;DR: Spreadsheet collaboration can be hindered by social factors and individual perceptions of expertise, suggesting a need for design that better supports knowledge sharing in complex software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: previous studies suggest that spreadsheet experts often fail to disseminate their knowledge to others. We suggest that social norms and beliefs surrounding the value of spreadsheet use significantly influence user engagement in sharing behaviours.

Method: 31 semi-structured interviews with professional spreadsheet users from two separate samples

Result: spreadsheet providers face challenges in adapting highly personalised strategies to often subjective standards and evaluating the appropriate social timing of sharing. In addition, conflicted self-evaluations of one's spreadsheet expertise, dismissive normative beliefs about the value of this knowledge, and concerns about the potential disruptions associated with collaboration can further deter sharing.

Conclusion:  the complex interaction between technology design and social dynamics can shape collaborative learning behaviours in the context of feature-rich software

Abstract: Spreadsheet collaboration provides valuable opportunities for learning and
expertise sharing between colleagues. Sharing expertise is essential for the
retention of important technical skillsets within organisations, but previous
studies suggest that spreadsheet experts often fail to disseminate their
knowledge to others. We suggest that social norms and beliefs surrounding the
value of spreadsheet use significantly influence user engagement in sharing
behaviours. To explore this, we conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with
professional spreadsheet users from two separate samples. We found that
spreadsheet providers face challenges in adapting highly personalised
strategies to often subjective standards and evaluating the appropriate social
timing of sharing. In addition, conflicted self-evaluations of one's
spreadsheet expertise, dismissive normative beliefs about the value of this
knowledge, and concerns about the potential disruptions associated with
collaboration can further deter sharing. We suggest these observations reflect
the challenges of long-term learning in feature-rich software designed
primarily with initial learnability in mind. We therefore provide implications
for design to navigate this tension. Overall, our findings demonstrate how the
complex interaction between technology design and social dynamics can shape
collaborative learning behaviours in the context of feature-rich software.

*Zeyu He,Saniya Naphade,Ting-Hao 'Kenneth' Huang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Prompting LLMs for data labeling without gold-standard benchmarks ("prompting in the dark") is unreliable. A study using PromptingSheet found that most users did not improve accuracy over iterations, and automated tools also struggled without gold labels. The findings emphasize the need for gold labels and careful design of automated support for prompt engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millions of users prompt large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, but how good are people at prompt engineering? Do users actually get closer to their desired outcome over multiple iterations of their prompts? These questions are crucial when no gold-standard labels are available to measure progress.

Method: We developed PromptingSheet, a Google Sheets add-on that enables users to compose, revise, and iteratively label data through spreadsheets. Through a study with 20 participants, we found that prompting in the dark was highly unreliable-only 9 participants improved labeling accuracy after four or more iterations. Automated prompt optimization tools like DSPy also struggled when few gold labels were available.

Result: Through a study with 20 participants, we found that prompting in the dark was highly unreliable-only 9 participants improved labeling accuracy after four or more iterations. Automated prompt optimization tools like DSPy also struggled when few gold labels were available.

Conclusion: Millions of users prompt large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, but how good are people at prompt engineering?

Abstract: Millions of users prompt large language models (LLMs) for various tasks, but
how good are people at prompt engineering? Do users actually get closer to
their desired outcome over multiple iterations of their prompts? These
questions are crucial when no gold-standard labels are available to measure
progress. This paper investigates a scenario in LLM-powered data labeling,
"prompting in the dark," where users iteratively prompt LLMs to label data
without using manually-labeled benchmarks. We developed PromptingSheet, a
Google Sheets add-on that enables users to compose, revise, and iteratively
label data through spreadsheets. Through a study with 20 participants, we found
that prompting in the dark was highly unreliable-only 9 participants improved
labeling accuracy after four or more iterations. Automated prompt optimization
tools like DSPy also struggled when few gold labels were available. Our
findings highlight the importance of gold labels and the needs, as well as the
risks, of automated support in human prompt engineering, providing insights for

TL;DR: 生成式AI在知识工作中有风险（“幻觉”），但也有机遇。最大的风险是人类批判性思维的退化。设计能够培养批判性思维的AI界面是关键。本研究提出了一个用于电子表格的AI筛选原型，并通过“挑衅”来审视AI标准，为AI辅助知识工作开辟了新方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在知识工作中可能引入错误（“幻觉”），但也为用户提供了学习和应用高级软件功能的机会，从而增加了他们能够成功完成的任务的范围和复杂性。然而，随着越来越多的工作可以安全地委托给AI，人类的批判性思维可能会受到损害。因此，有必要设计能够培养和鼓励批判性思维的生成式AI系统界面。

Method: 该研究提出了一个利用生成式AI进行关键筛选的原型系统，该系统能够建议筛选标准、对电子表格进行排序，并生成“挑衅”文本来批评AI生成的标准，突出风险、缺点和替代方案。

Result: 该研究提出了一个用于电子表格关键筛选的原型系统，并探讨了AI作为批评者或挑衅者的研究议程，包括挑衅出现的时间、形式、内容以及潜在的设计权衡。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在知识工作中带来了风险和机遇。虽然“幻觉”会引入错误，但它也为用户提供了学习和应用高级软件功能的机会。然而，最大的风险在于人类批判性思维的退化。通过设计能够培养批判性思维的生成式AI界面，可以应对这些挑战。该研究提出了一个利用生成式AI进行关键筛选的原型系统，并通过“挑衅”来审视AI生成的标准，从而开辟了AI辅助知识工作批判性思维工具的设计空间，并为未来的研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Generative AI, with its tendency to "hallucinate" incorrect results, may pose
a risk to knowledge work by introducing errors. On the other hand, it may also
provide unprecedented opportunities for users, particularly non-experts, to
learn and apply advanced software features and greatly increase the scope and
complexity of tasks they can successfully achieve.
  As an example of a complex knowledge workflow that is subject to risks and
opportunities from generative AI, we consider the spreadsheet. AI
hallucinations are an important challenge, but they are not the greatest risk
posed by generative AI to spreadsheet workflows. Rather, as more work can be
safely delegated to AI, the risk is that human critical thinking -- the ability
to holistically and rigorously evaluate a problem and its solutions -- is
degraded in the process. The solution is to design the interfaces of generative
AI systems deliberately to foster and encourage critical thinking in knowledge
work, building primarily on a long history of research on critical thinking
tools for education.
  We discuss a prototype system for the activity of critical shortlisting in
spreadsheets. The system uses generative AI to suggest shortlisting criteria
and applies these criteria to sort rows in a spreadsheet. It also generates
"provocations": short text snippets that critique the AI-generated criteria,
highlighting risks, shortcomings, and alternatives. Our prototype opens up a
rich and completely unexplored design space of critical thinking tools for
modern AI-assisted knowledge work. We outline a research agenda for AI as a
critic or provocateur, including questions about where and when provocations
should appear, their form and content, and potential design trade-offs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于生成式AI的幻觉、偏差和用户技能差异等问题，无法保证生成公式的准确性和可靠性，需要一个信任框架来解决这些挑战。

Method: 通过评估公式的可解释性、可见性、可靠性和道德性来构建信任框架，并分析了幻觉、训练数据偏差和提示词构造不良等因素对这些指标的影响。

Result: 研究探讨了提高生成式AI电子表格公式透明度和可信度的关键因素，并考虑了不信任技术的例子及其后果。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个基于透明度和可信度的生成式AI电子表格公式的信任框架，以解决AI生成公式的准确性和可靠性问题。

Abstract: Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for automating
spreadsheet formula creation. However, due to hallucinations, bias and variable
user skill, outputs obtained from generative AI cannot be assumed to be
accurate or trustworthy. To address these challenges, a trustworthiness
framework is proposed based on evaluating the transparency and dependability of
the formula. The transparency of the formula is explored through explainability
(understanding the formula's reasoning) and visibility (inspecting the
underlying algorithms). The dependability of the generated formula is evaluated
in terms of reliability (consistency and accuracy) and ethical considerations
(bias and fairness). The paper also examines the drivers to these metrics in
the form of hallucinations, training data bias and poorly constructed prompts.
Finally, examples of mistrust in technology are considered and the consequences
explored.

### [28] [Dynamic Prompt Middleware: Contextual Prompt Refinement Controls for Comprehension Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02357)
*Ian Drosos,Jack Williams,Advait Sarkar,Nicholas Wilson*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了用户在理解任务中控制AI生成解释的需求，并提出了一种名为Dynamic PRC的提示中间件方法，该方法通过提供上下文相关的UI元素来帮助用户改进提示。实验结果表明，Dynamic PRC优于Static PRC，能提供更好的用户控制和体验，但用户在理解控件对输出的影响方面仍有待改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的有效提示对许多用户来说具有挑战性，特别是在为理解任务（例如，解释电子表格公式、Python代码和文本段落）表达上下文时。提示中间件旨在通过辅助提示构建来解决这一障碍，但用户在表达充分控制以使他们能够获得符合其偏好的AI响应方面仍然存在障碍。

Method: 通过一项包含38名参与者的形成性调查，研究了用户对AI生成解释的控制需求。然后，我们实现了两种提示中间件方法：动态提示改进控制（Dynamic PRC）和静态提示改进控制（Static PRC）。最后，通过一项包含16名参与者的对照用户研究，评估了这两种方法对用户控制AI响应以制作更好解释的影响。

Result: 研究结果显示，用户更倾向于Dynamic PRC方法，因为它提供了更多的控制，降低了提供上下文的障碍，并鼓励对任务进行探索和反思。然而，用户在推理不同生成的控件对最终输出的影响方面仍然面临挑战。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，动态提示中间件可以通过提供更大的控制力来改善生成式人工智能工作流的用户体验，并引导用户获得更好的AI响应。

Abstract: Effective prompting of generative AI is challenging for many users,
particularly in expressing context for comprehension tasks such as explaining
spreadsheet formulas, Python code, and text passages. Prompt middleware aims to
address this barrier by assisting in prompt construction, but barriers remain
for users in expressing adequate control so that they can receive AI-responses
that match their preferences.
  We conduct a formative survey (n=38) investigating user needs for control
over AI-generated explanations in comprehension tasks, which uncovers a
trade-off between standardized but predictable support for prompting, and
adaptive but unpredictable support tailored to the user and task. To explore
this trade-off, we implement two prompt middleware approaches: Dynamic Prompt
Refinement Control (Dynamic PRC) and Static Prompt Refinement Control (Static
PRC). The Dynamic PRC approach generates context-specific UI elements that
provide prompt refinements based on the user's prompt and user needs from the
AI, while the Static PRC approach offers a preset list of generally applicable
refinements.
  We evaluate these two approaches with a controlled user study (n=16) to
assess the impact of these approaches on user control of AI responses for
crafting better explanations. Results show a preference for the Dynamic PRC
approach as it afforded more control, lowered barriers to providing context,
and encouraged exploration and reflection of the tasks, but that reasoning
about the effects of different generated controls on the final output remains
challenging. Drawing on participant feedback, we discuss design implications
for future Dynamic PRC systems that enhance user control of AI responses. Our
findings suggest that dynamic prompt middleware can improve the user experience
of generative AI workflows by affording greater control and guide users to a
better AI response.

Result: 解决方案还揭示了分析、理解、规划和讨论任务与电子表格中的活动同样重要，而这个过程在为学生的未来工作做准备方面起着至关重要的作用。

Conclusion: 在技术教学法和内容知识的框架内，学科整合是学校有意义地引入数字化和数字化的一种可能的解决方案。这个过程包含任何学校科目都可以用数字支持进行教学，信息学（计算机）课程可以情境化，并且“严肃的信息学”和“数字素养”之间的差距可以最小化。

Abstract: Within the framework of Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge,
subject integration is one possible solution for the introduction of meaningful
digitalization and digitization in schools. This process incorporates that any
school subject can be taught with digital support, informatics (computer)
classes can be contextualized, and the gap between 'serious informatics' and
'digital literacy' can be minimized. The present paper details how three
traditional Grade 3 tasks can be solved in spreadsheets, what skills,
competencies, and computer science knowledge of both teachers and students can
be developed. The solutions also reveal that analysing, understanding,
planning, and discussing tasks is as important as the activity in the
spreadsheets, which process plays a crucial role in the preparation of students
for their future jobs.

Result: 学生的电子表格能力自我评估不准确，在数字环境中完成任务比纸质环境需要更长时间。这表明数字原住民学生并非天生就会使用计算机。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，大学生往往会不准确地评估他们在电子表格方面的能力，并且在数字环境中完成任务所需的时间是纸质环境的两倍。这挑战了“数字原住民”学生无需计算机科学教育即可掌握技术的假设。

Abstract: The present paper aims to explore higher education students' spreadsheet
competencies and reliability through self-assessment and real-world
problem-solving practices. Digital natives alleged skills and competences
allowed us to hypothesize that students perform better in Excel than on paper,
but the findings cannot confirm this hypothesis. However, our results indicate
that students tend to inaccurately assess their spreadsheet competencies
compared to their actual performance in both paper-based and Excel tasks. It
has also be found that students need at least twice as much time to achieve the
same high scores in the digital environment as they do on paper. The results
violated the widely accepted assumption that digital native students do not
need computer science education, since they are born with it. This study
highlights the importance of accurate self-assessment in digital skill
development and time management within higher education contexts, particularly
in technology-driven disciplines.

this trust established? In this paper, we present the results of a series of
interviews with both producers and consumers of data artifacts (outputs of data
ecosystems like spreadsheets, charts, and dashboards) aimed at understanding
strategies and obstacles to building trust in data. We find a recurring need,
but lack of existing standards, for data validation and verification,
especially among data consumers. We therefore propose a set of data guards:

Abstract: Video tutorials are a popular medium for informal and formal learning.
However, when learners attempt to view and follow along with these tutorials,
they encounter what we call gaps, that is, issues that can prevent learning. We
examine the gaps encountered by users of video tutorials for feature-rich
software, such as spreadsheets. We develop a theory and taxonomy of such gaps,
identifying how they act as barriers to learning, by collecting and analyzing
360 viewer comments from 90 Microsoft Excel video tutorials published by 43
creators across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. We conducted contextual
interviews with 8 highly influential tutorial creators to investigate the gaps

Motivation: Crowdsourced labeling is time consuming and expensive, and current methods often involve effort and tedium. This paper aims to address these concerns by designing a more efficient and user-friendly data labeling interface.

Method: CAL is a novel interface designed to aid in data labeling. Key design decisions include preventing inapt labels, guiding users, incorporating labeling documentation, and providing an efficient means to view previous labels. A user study was conducted comparing CAL to a standard spreadsheet.

Conclusion: CAL is a novel interface designed to aid in data labeling, which was found to be easier to use, have lower cognitive load, and be preferred by users compared to a standard spreadsheet.

Abstract: Without well-labeled ground truth data, machine learning-based systems would
not be as ubiquitous as they are today, but these systems rely on substantial
amounts of correctly labeled data. Unfortunately, crowdsourced labeling is time
consuming and expensive. To address the concerns of effort and tedium, we
designed CAL, a novel interface to aid in data labeling. We made several key
design decisions for CAL, which include preventing inapt labels from being
selected, guiding users in selecting an appropriate label when they need
assistance, incorporating labeling documentation into the interface, and
providing an efficient means to view previous labels. We implemented a
production-quality implementation of CAL and report a user-study evaluation
that compares CAL to a standard spreadsheet. Key findings of our study include
users using CAL reported lower cognitive load, did not increase task time,
users rated CAL to be easier to use, and users preferred CAL over the

Conclusion: 本研究提炼了支持文本到图像（TTI）设计空间探索的界面功能，并通过UI模型指导未来的界面设计。

Abstract: Design space exploration (DSE) for Text-to-Image (TTI) models entails
navigating a vast, opaque space of possible image outputs, through a
commensurately vast input space of hyperparameters and prompt text. Minor
adjustments to prompt input can surface unexpectedly disparate images. How can
interfaces support end-users in reliably steering prompt-space explorations
towards interesting results? Our design probe, DreamSheets, supports
exploration strategies with LLM-based functions for assisted prompt
construction and simultaneous display of generated results, hosted in a
spreadsheet interface. The flexible layout and novel generative functions
enable experimentation with user-defined workflows. Two studies, a preliminary
lab study and a longitudinal study with five expert artists, revealed a set of
strategies participants use to tackle the challenges of TTI design space
exploration, and the interface features required to support them - like using
text-generation to define local "axes" of exploration. We distill these
insights into a UI mockup to guide future interfaces.

Motivation: 随着 ChatGPT 等人工智能工具的出现，研究人类认知能力如何被这些工具增强，以及它们是否会取代人类的专业知识至关重要。

Method: 通过进行两项实验来比较使用 ChatGPT 和不使用 ChatGPT 所创建的回应，以研究使用 ChatGPT 对人类认知增强的影响。

Result: 研究发现，使用 ChatGPT 并不总能带来认知增强，也不能取代特定任务中的人类判断、辨别和评估。有时，ChatGPT 会误导用户，导致认知能力下降。

Conclusion: 使用 ChatGPT 进行研究表明，它并不总能增强认知能力，也不能取代人类的判断、辨别和评估。在某些情况下，它甚至可能误导用户，导致负面的认知增强。

Abstract: Human cognitive performance is enhanced by the use of tools. For example, a
human can produce a much greater, and more accurate, volume of mathematical
calculation in a unit of time using a calculator or a spreadsheet application
on a computer. Such tools have taken over the burden of lower level cognitive
grunt work but the human still serves the role of the expert performing higher
level thinking and reasoning. Recently, however, unsupervised, deep, machine
learning has produced cognitive systems able to outperform humans in several
domains. When humans use these tools in a human cog ensemble, the cognitive
ability of the human is augmented. In some cases, even non experts can achieve,
and even exceed, the performance of experts in a particular domain, synthetic
expertise. A new cognitive system, ChatGPT, has burst onto the scene during the
past year. This paper investigates human cognitive augmentation due to using
ChatGPT by presenting the results of two experiments comparing responses
created using ChatGPT with results created not using ChatGPT. We find using
ChatGPT does not always result in cognitive augmentation and does not yet
replace human judgement, discernment, and evaluation in certain types of tasks.
In fact, ChatGPT was observed to result in misleading users resulting in
negative cognitive augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI-generated content becomes more complex (e.g., summaries, tables, code), it is increasingly difficult for users to audit or evaluate its quality and correctness, necessitating the development of co-audit tools to assist users in double-checking AI output.

Method: This paper describes recent research on co-audit tools for spreadsheet computations powered by generative models, explaining their necessity and proposing a preliminary list of principles and research challenges.

Result: The paper discusses the importance of co-audit tools for generative AI applications where quality and correctness are crucial, using spreadsheet computations as a specific example. It also outlines principles for co-audit and identifies research challenges.

Conclusion: As AI-generated content becomes more complex, tool-assisted experiences, or co-audit tools, are emerging to help users check for correctness, especially in consequential applications like spreadsheet computations. This paper explores co-audit tools for generative AI, proposes principles for their design, and outlines future research challenges.

Abstract: Users are increasingly being warned to check AI-generated content for
correctness. Still, as LLMs (and other generative models) generate more complex
output, such as summaries, tables, or code, it becomes harder for the user to
audit or evaluate the output for quality or correctness. Hence, we are seeing
the emergence of tool-assisted experiences to help the user double-check a
piece of AI-generated content. We refer to these as co-audit tools. Co-audit
tools complement prompt engineering techniques: one helps the user construct
the input prompt, while the other helps them check the output response. As a
specific example, this paper describes recent research on co-audit tools for
spreadsheet computations powered by generative models. We explain why co-audit
experiences are essential for any application of generative AI where quality is
important and errors are consequential (as is common in spreadsheet
computations). We propose a preliminary list of principles for co-audit, and
outline research challenges.

Conclusion: 该方法通过将代码转换回系统化、可预测的自然语言表达来弥合抽象鸿沟，从而改进了最终用户对代码生成模型的理解，以及使用它所需的语言。

Abstract: Code-generating large language models translate natural language into code.
However, only a small portion of the infinite space of naturalistic utterances
is effective at guiding code generation. For non-expert end-user programmers,
learning this is the challenge of abstraction matching. We examine this
challenge in the specific context of data analysis in spreadsheets, in a system
that maps the users natural language query to Python code using the Codex
generator, executes the code, and shows the result. We propose grounded
abstraction matching, which bridges the abstraction gap by translating the code
back into a systematic and predictable naturalistic utterance. In a
between-subjects, think-aloud study (n=24), we compare grounded abstraction
matching to an ungrounded alternative based on previously established query
framing principles. We find that the grounded approach improves end-users'
understanding of the scope and capabilities of the code-generating model, and
the kind of language needed to use it effectively.

Motivation: To explore the similarities and differences between LLM-assisted programming and previous conceptualizations of programmer assistance, and to identify potential issues and research challenges in applying LLMs to end-user programming.

Method: The study analyzes publicly available experience reports and prior usability studies on LLM-assisted programming. It also draws on observations from a user study involving non-expert end-user programmers using LLM-assisted tools in spreadsheets.

Result: LLM-assisted programming shares some properties with compilation, pair programming, and programming via search and reuse, but possesses fundamental differences in both technical capabilities and practical experience. Applying LLMs to end-user programming, especially for users with limited programming expertise, presents specific challenges.

Conclusion: LLM-assisted programming represents a new paradigm with distinct properties and challenges, particularly when applied to end-user programming with non-expert users.

Abstract: Large language models, such as OpenAI's codex and Deepmind's AlphaCode, can
generate code to solve a variety of problems expressed in natural language.
This technology has already been commercialised in at least one widely-used
programming editor extension: GitHub Copilot.
  In this paper, we explore how programming with large language models
(LLM-assisted programming) is similar to, and differs from, prior
conceptualisations of programmer assistance. We draw upon publicly available
experience reports of LLM-assisted programming, as well as prior usability and
design studies. We find that while LLM-assisted programming shares some
properties of compilation, pair programming, and programming via search and
reuse, there are fundamental differences both in the technical possibilities as
well as the practical experience. Thus, LLM-assisted programming ought to be
viewed as a new way of programming with its own distinct properties and
challenges.
  Finally, we draw upon observations from a user study in which non-expert end
user programmers use LLM-assisted tools for solving data tasks in spreadsheets.
We discuss the issues that might arise, and open research challenges, in
applying large language models to end-user programming, particularly with users
who have little or no programming expertise.

### [41] [MetaGlyph: Automatic Generation of Metaphoric Glyph-based Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05739)
*Lu Ying,Xinhuan Shu,Dazhen Deng,Yuchen Yang,Tan Tang,Lingyun Yu,Yingcai Wu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: MetaGlyph是一个能自动从电子表格生成视觉隐喻图形（MGV）的系统，通过分析现有设计、自动选择隐喻图像并结合蒙特卡洛树搜索算法来优化设计，同时允许用户自定义，有效解决了手动创建MGV的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动创建隐喻图形可视化（MGV）并非易事，它需要对数据的深入理解和专业的设计技能。此研究旨在解决这一挑战。

Method: 1. 定性分析：从隐喻体现和图形设计角度对现有MGV进行分析。
2. 框架设计：提出一种新的MGV生成框架，包括隐喻图像选择和MGV构建。
3. 自动选择隐喻：基于输入数据的语义自动选择具有相应图像的隐喻。
4. 集成MCTS算法：通过蒙特卡洛树搜索算法探索MGV设计，关联视觉元素和数据维度，并考虑数据重要性、语义相关性和图形不重叠。
5. 提供编辑反馈：允许用户根据设计偏好自定义MGV。

Result: MetaGlyph系统能够自动生成MGV，并通过示例、使用场景、专家访谈等方式展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: MetaGlyph系统能够根据用户输入的电子表格数据，自动生成具有图形表现力和信息传达能力的视觉隐喻图形（MGV）。

Abstract: Glyph-based visualization achieves an impressive graphic design when
associated with comprehensive visual metaphors, which help audiences
effectively grasp the conveyed information through revealing data semantics.
However, creating such metaphoric glyph-based visualization (MGV) is not an
easy task, as it requires not only a deep understanding of data but also
professional design skills. This paper proposes MetaGlyph, an automatic system
for generating MGVs from a spreadsheet. To develop MetaGlyph, we first conduct
a qualitative analysis to understand the design of current MGVs from the
perspectives of metaphor embodiment and glyph design. Based on the results, we
introduce a novel framework for generating MGVs by metaphoric image selection
and an MGV construction. Specifically, MetaGlyph automatically selects
metaphors with corresponding images from online resources based on the input
data semantics. We then integrate a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that
explores the design of an MGV by associating visual elements with data
dimensions given the data importance, semantic relevance, and glyph
non-overlap. The system also provides editing feedback that allows users to
customize the MGVs according to their design preferences. We demonstrate the
use of MetaGlyph through a set of examples, one usage scenario, and validate
its effectiveness through a series of expert interviews.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to support mobile knowledge workers by
complementing traditional input devices with a large three-dimensional output
space and spatial input. Previous research on supporting VR knowledge work
explored domains such as text entry using physical keyboards and spreadsheet
interaction using combined pen and touch input. Inspired by such work, this
paper probes the VR design space for authoring presentations in mobile
settings. We propose PoVRPoint -- a set of tools coupling pen- and touch-based
editing of presentations on mobile devices, such as tablets, with the
interaction capabilities afforded by VR. We study the utility of extended
display space to, for example, assist users in identifying target slides,
supporting spatial manipulation of objects on a slide, creating animations, and
facilitating arrangements of multiple, possibly occluded, shapes. Among other
things, our results indicate that 1) the wide field of view afforded by VR
results in significantly faster target slide identification times compared to a
tablet-only interface for visually salient targets; and 2) the
three-dimensional view in VR enables significantly faster object reordering in
the presence of occlusion compared to two baseline interfaces. A user study
further confirmed that the interaction techniques were found to be usable and
enjoyable.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 电子表格不仅仅是数据清理工具，用户希望在整个分析过程中都能直接操作数据。交互式表格是一种重要的可视化形式，值得在可视化分析工具中进一步探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多数据工作者在信息生态系统中仍然依赖电子表格等表格工具，这些工具能让他们以更复杂工具所隐藏或抽象的方式与数据进行交互。

Method: 定性研究，旨在观察数据工作者如何与数据交互和推理。

Result: 研究发现，数据表不仅在分析流程的初始阶段用于数据清理，在整个分析过程中，用户都希望能够直接操作、重塑和增强数据，以便支持其分析过程。用户在基本数据上下文中进行重组、标记、添加详细信息和生成不同版本的数据。这些直接交互和人类可读的表格表示构成了理解数据含义和可操作性的重要认知组成部分。

Conclusion: 交互式表格本身就是一种重要的可视化形式，它们提供的直接数据交互为可视化分析开辟了丰富的设计空间，并且更灵活的人-数据交互可以丰富分析过程。

Abstract: Working with data in table form is usually considered a preparatory and
tedious step in the sensemaking pipeline; a way of getting the data ready for
more sophisticated visualization and analytical tools. But for many people,
spreadsheets -- the quintessential table tool -- remain a critical part of
their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways
that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true
for data workers: people who work with data as part of their job but do not
identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a
qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their
data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data
cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and
"get their hands on" the underlying data throughout the analytics process,
reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up,
layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the
base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations
form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what
the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables
are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data
interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and
that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than
is currently supported in visual analytics tools.

TL;DR: Calliope是一个能从电子表格自动生成可视化数据故事的系统，它使用一种创新的搜索算法来排序数据事实，并通过图表和文字进行可视化，大大提高了数据故事的生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可视化数据故事生成工具通常依赖用户的技能和经验，效率低下且难以使用，存在技术门槛（如数据分析、可视化和脚本编写），因此需要一种更便捷的自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为Calliope的新型可视化数据故事生成系统。该系统能够从输入的电子表格自动生成可视化数据故事，并通过在线编辑器方便用户修改。其核心是一个新颖的逻辑导向蒙特卡洛树搜索算法，该算法探索输入电子表格提供的数据空间，逐步生成故事片段（数据事实）并进行逻辑排序。数据事实的重要性通过信息论进行度量，每个数据事实都配有自动生成的图表和描述。

Conclusion: Calliope系统通过自动化流程，利用基于信息论重要性度量的逻辑导向的蒙特卡洛树搜索算法，从电子表格生成可视化数据故事，并且允许用户通过在线编辑器轻松修改，最终证明了其在高效生成可视化数据故事方面的优势。

Abstract: Visual data stories shown in the form of narrative visualizations such as a
poster or a data video, are frequently used in data-oriented storytelling to
facilitate the understanding and memorization of the story content. Although
useful, technique barriers, such as data analysis, visualization, and
scripting, make the generation of a visual data story difficult. Existing
authoring tools rely on users' skills and experiences, which are usually
inefficient and still difficult. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual
data story generating system, Calliope, which creates visual data stories from
an input spreadsheet through an automatic process and facilities the easy
revision of the generated story based on an online story editor. Particularly,
Calliope incorporates a new logic-oriented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm
that explores the data space given by the input spreadsheet to progressively
generate story pieces (i.e., data facts) and organize them in a logical order.
The importance of data facts is measured based on information theory, and each
data fact is visualized in a chart and captioned by an automatically generated
description. We evaluate the proposed technique through three example stories,
two controlled experiments, and a series of interviews with 10 domain experts.
Our evaluation shows that Calliope is beneficial to efficient visual data story
generation.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) can enhance the display and interaction of mobile
knowledge work and in particular, spreadsheet applications. While spreadsheets
are widely used yet are challenging to interact with, especially on mobile
devices, using them in VR has not been explored in depth. A special uniqueness
of the domain is the contrast between the immersive and large display space
afforded by VR, contrasted by the very limited interaction space that may be
afforded for the information worker on the go, such as an airplane seat or a
small work-space. To close this gap, we present a tool-set for enhancing
spreadsheet interaction on tablets using immersive VR headsets and pen-based
input. This combination opens up many possibilities for enhancing the
productivity for spreadsheet interaction. We propose to use the space around
and in front of the tablet for enhanced visualization of spreadsheet data and
meta-data. For example, extending sheet display beyond the bounds of the
physical screen, or easier debugging by uncovering hidden dependencies between
sheet's cells. Combining the precise on-screen input of a pen with spatial
sensing around the tablet, we propose tools for the efficient creation and
editing of spreadsheets functions such as off-the-screen layered menus,
visualization of sheets dependencies, and gaze-and-touch-based switching
between spreadsheet tabs. We study the feasibility of the proposed tool-set
using a video-based online survey and an expert-based assessment of indicative
human performance potential.

developed can be easily misunderstood. The development process was one of
iterative refinement engaging an initial target audience of mid-teen learners,

Conclusion: Taggle是一种以用户为中心、类似电子表格的方法，通过可视化每行数据并结合数据驱动的聚合以及专门的交互方法，来探索和呈现大型复杂表格，适用于药物发现等领域。

Abstract: Most tabular data visualization techniques focus on overviews, yet many
practical analysis tasks are concerned with investigating individual items of
interest. At the same time, relating an item to the rest of a potentially large
table is important. In this work we present Taggle, a tabular visualization
technique for exploring and presenting large and complex tables. Taggle takes
an item-centric, spreadsheet-like approach, visualizing each row in the source
data individually using visual encodings for the cells. At the same time,
Taggle introduces data-driven aggregation of data subsets. The aggregation
strategy is complemented by interaction methods tailored to answer specific
analysis questions, such as sorting based on multiple columns and rich data
selection and filtering capabilities. We demonstrate Taggle using a case study
conducted by a domain expert on complex genomics data analysis for the purpose
of drug discovery.

Conclusion: 学生需要高阶数学能力、基于算法的官方培训和专家教师的指导。

Abstract: The present paper reports the results of testing first year students of
Informatics on their algorithmic skills and knowledge transfer abilities in
spreadsheet environments. The selection of students plays a crucial role in the
project. On the one hand, they have officially finished their spreadsheet
training - they know everything - while on the other hand, they do not need any
training, since they are digital natives, to whom digital skills are assigned
by birth. However, we found that the students had serious difficulties in
solving the spreadsheet problems presented: so low were their results that it
allowed us to form broad tendencies. Considering computational thinking,
algorithmic skills, and knowledge transfer abilities, it is clear that those
students performed better who used algorithm-based, multilevel array formulas
instead of problem specific, unconnected built-in functions. Furthermore, we
can conclude that students, regardless of their birth date and digital
generation assigned to them, are in great need of official, high-mathability,
algorithm-based training with expert teachers.

Motivation: 为了解用户在电子表格中处理不确定性的现状，因为用户在处理概率时常使用启发式方法，导致错误结论，并且常常忽略或简化不确定性。

Method: 通过对11位来自不同领域的电子表格用户进行访谈研究，了解用户当前如何处理电子表格中的不确定性。

Result: 用户的目标包括计算和比较不同情景、了解不确定性的性质以及将复杂的不确定性数据简化呈现给决策者。用户在处理不确定性时，会受到电子表格在工作中的角色以及用户目标的影响。

Conclusion: 用户处理不确定性的方式受到电子表格在工作中的作用和用户目标的影响。电子表格目前提供的工具有限，用户需要采用各种变通方法。

Abstract: Spreadsheet users regularly deal with uncertainty in their data, for example
due to errors and estimates. While an insight into data uncertainty can help in
making better informed decisions, prior research suggests that people often use
informal heuristics to reason with probabilities, which leads to incorrect
conclusions. Moreover, people often ignore or simplify uncertainty. To
understand how people currently encounter and deal with uncertainty in
spreadsheets, we conducted an interview study with 11 spreadsheet users from a
range of domains. We found that how people deal with uncertainty is influenced
by the role the spreadsheet plays in people's work and the user's aims.
Spreadsheets are used as a database, template, calculation tool, notepad and
exploration tool. In doing so, participants' aims were to compute and compare
different scenarios, understand something about the nature of the uncertainty
in their situation, and translate the complexity of data uncertainty into
simplified presentations to other people, usually decision-makers. Spreadsheets
currently provide limited tools to support these aims, and participants had
various workarounds.

we set out to apply this method of using online forum data to a specific
issue---challenges that users face with Excel spreadsheets. Spreadsheets are a
versatile and powerful processing tool if used properly. However, with
versatility and power come errors, from both users and the software, which make
using spreadsheets less effective. By scraping posts from the website Reddit,
we collected a dataset of questions and complaints about Excel. Specifically,

### [54] [Is spreadsheet syntax better than numeric indexing for cell selection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23296)
*Philip Heltweg,Dirk Riehle,Georg-Daniel Schwarz*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Spreadsheet-style syntax is better than numeric indexing for selecting cells in data engineering, making code easier and faster to read and write, particularly for non-programmers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation was to compare two common approaches for cell selection in data engineering (numeric indexing and spreadsheet-style syntax) in terms of efficiency and accuracy, to inform the design of future data engineering tools.

Method: A large-scale controlled experiment was conducted with student participants, comparing the speed and correctness of reading and writing code using numeric indexing versus spreadsheet-style syntax for cell selection.

Result: Participants made fewer mistakes when reading code using spreadsheet-style syntax. When writing code, they were faster and made fewer mistakes with spreadsheet syntax compared to numeric syntax.

Conclusion: The study suggests that spreadsheet-style syntax is a promising alternative to numeric syntax for cell selection in data engineering, especially for practitioners without a software engineering background, as it leads to fewer errors and faster execution.

Abstract: Selecting a subset of cells is a common task in data engineering, for
example, to remove errors or select only specific parts of a table. Multiple
approaches to express this selection exist. One option is numeric indexing,
commonly found in general programming languages, where a tuple of numbers
identifies the cell. Alternatively, the separate dimensions can be referred to
using different enumeration schemes like "A1" for the first cell, commonly
found in software such as spreadsheet systems.
  In a large-scale controlled experiment with student participants as proxy for
data practitioners, we compare the two options with respect to speed and
correctness of reading and writing code.
  The results show that, when reading code, participants make less mistakes
using spreadsheet-style syntax. Additionally, when writing code, they make
fewer mistakes and are faster when using spreadsheet syntax compared to numeric
syntax.
  From this, a domain-specific syntax, such as spreadsheet syntax for data
engineering, appears to be a promising alternative to explore in future tools
to support practitioners without a software engineering background.

TL;DR: LLM在处理表格数据任务时，通过“聚类后选择”技术并提供代表性数据行，可以提高其性能，尤其是在数据语法多变的情况下。研究人员还为此创建了一个数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在编程辅助方面表现出色，但对于需要处理表格数据的任务，如何有效地在提示中包含数据是一个关键问题。本研究旨在解决如何决定在提示中包含多少数据以及哪些数据，以提高LLM在数据处理任务中的性能。

Method: 本研究提出了“聚类后选择”提示技术，该技术通过将最具代表性的数据行添加到LLM提示中来优化LLM在处理数据密集型任务时的表现。此外，研究人员创建了一个包含真实世界自然语言到代码任务的数据集，这些任务是从StackOverflow帖子中提取的，专注于表格数据操作。

Result: 实验表明，LLM在处理需要表格数据的任务时的性能确实受到提示中数据量的影响。所提出的“聚类后选择”技术比随机选择基线更能有效提升LLM在处理具有高语法变异性的表格数据任务时的表现。

Conclusion: LLM在处理数据密集型任务方面，尤其是对于非专业程序员和终端用户，正逐渐取代传统的帮助论坛。LLM的性能对提示中提供的数据量敏感，所提出的“聚类后选择”方法在处理具有高语法变异性的表格数据任务时，优于随机选择基线。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly replacing help forums like
StackOverflow, and are especially helpful for non-professional programmers and
end users. These users are often interested in data-centric tasks, such as
spreadsheet manipulation and data wrangling, which are hard to solve if the
intent is only communicated using a natural-language description, without
including the data. But how do we decide how much data and which data to
include in the prompt? This paper makes two contributions towards answering
this question. First, we create a dataset of real-world NL-to-code tasks
manipulating tabular data, mined from StackOverflow posts. Second, we introduce
a cluster-then-select prompting technique, which adds the most representative
rows from the input data to the LLM prompt. Our experiments show that LLM
performance is indeed sensitive to the amount of data passed in the prompt, and
that for tasks with a lot of syntactic variation in the input table, our
cluster-then-select technique outperforms a random selection baseline.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: FLAME is a small, efficient language model for Excel formulas that performs as well as or better than much larger models in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulties of using large language models for spreadsheet formula authoring assistance due to their size and training costs. The goal is to create a smaller, more efficient model with competitive performance.

Method: FLAME, a transformer-based model, leverages domain insights, sketch deduplication for dataset curation, an Excel-specific formula tokenizer, and domain-specific pre-training objectives (masked span prediction and noisy auto-encoding).

Result: FLAME outperforms much larger models like Davinci (175B), Cushman (12B), and CodeT5 (220M) in 10 out of 14 evaluation settings for formula repair and completion. It also outperforms CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT in formula retrieval.

Conclusion: FLAME, a 60M parameter transformer model trained on Excel formulas, achieves competitive performance with much larger models in formula repair, completion, and retrieval tasks. It outperforms Davinci, Cushman, CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT in several settings.

Abstract: Spreadsheets are a vital tool for end-user data management. Using large
language models for formula authoring assistance in these environments can be
difficult, as these models are expensive to train and challenging to deploy due
to their size (up to billions of parameters). We present FLAME, a
transformer-based model trained exclusively on Excel formulas that leverages
domain insights to achieve competitive performance while being substantially
smaller (60M parameters) and training on two orders of magnitude less data. We
curate a training dataset using sketch deduplication, introduce an
Excel-specific formula tokenizer, and use domain-specific versions of masked
span prediction and noisy auto-encoding as pre-training objectives. We evaluate
FLAME on formula repair, formula completion, and similarity-based formula
retrieval. FLAME can outperform much larger models, such as the Davinci (175B)
and Cushman (12B) variants of Codex and CodeT5 (220M), in 10 of 14 evaluation
settings for the repair and completion tasks. For formula retrieval, FLAME
outperforms CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格因其易用性和广泛应用性而成为常用的计算工具，但其单向数据流的限制了其在记账类应用之外的广泛使用。本研究旨在打破这一限制，将电子表格计算范例扩展到解决约束满足问题。

Method: 提出了一种增强的电子表格系统，为有限域约束求解提供了良好的可视化环境，并构建了一种电子表格特定的约束语言，以便用户以声明式和可扩展的方式指定数据单元之间的约束。

Result: 新的电子表格系统通过可视化表格界面显著简化了许多基于约束的应用程序的开发，并且易用性和实用性得到了例证。

Conclusion: 该研究通过增强电子表格系统和构建特定于电子表格的约束语言，成功地将电子表格计算范例扩展到解决约束满足问题，简化了许多基于约束的应用程序的开发。

Abstract: The spreadsheet application is among the most widely used computing tools in
modern society. It provides excellent usability and usefulness, and it easily
enables a non-programmer to perform programming-like tasks in a visual tabular
"pen and paper" approach. However, spreadsheets are mostly limited to
bookkeeping-like applications due to their mono-directional data flow. This
paper shows how the spreadsheet computing paradigm is extended to break this
limitation for solving constraint satisfaction problems. We present an enhanced
spreadsheet system where finite-domain constraint solving is well supported in
a visual environment. Furthermore, a spreadsheet-specific constraint language
is constructed for general users to specify constraints among data cells in a
declarative and scalable way. The new spreadsheet system significantly
simplifies the development of many constraint-based applications using a visual
tabular interface. Examples are given to illustrate the usability and
usefulness of the extended spreadsheet paradigm.

### [58] [Typed Image-based Programming with Structure Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08993)
*Jonathan Edwards,Tomas Petricek*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Image-based programming (like Smalltalk) is simple but bad for collaboration. We fix this using static types and structure editing to manage data changes, creating a version control system for these edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based programming systems offer a simpler and more exploratory programming experience but lack collaboration and deployment support compared to file-based systems. This limits their commercial success.

Method: Using static types to manage schema changes and structure editing to capture type definition changes, enabling automatic data adaptation. Developing a theory for version control of structure editing to support collaboration.

Result: The paper proposes a method to enable collaboration in image-based programming through static types and structure editing, focusing on schema change management for persistent data. A theory for version control of structure editing is presented as the main technical contribution, with the potential to extend to the entire programming experience.

Conclusion: We present a theory for version control of structure editing, which can enable collaboration in image-based programming by handling schema changes in persistent data.

Abstract: Many beloved programming systems are image-based: self-contained worlds that
persist both code and data in a single file. Examples include Smalltalk, LISP,
HyperCard, Flash, and spreadsheets. Image-based programming avoids much of the
complexity of modern programming technology stacks and encourages more casual
and exploratory programming. However conventional file-based programming has
better support for collaboration and deployment. These problems have been
blamed for the limited commercial success of Smalltalk. We propose to enable
collaboration in image-based programming via types and structure editing.
  We focus on the problem of schema change on persistent data. We turn to
static types, which paradoxically require more schema change but also provide a
mechanism to express and execute those changes. To determine those changes we
turn to structure editing, so that we can capture changes in type definitions
with sufficient fidelity to automatically adapt the data to suit. We conjecture
that typical schema changes can be handled through structure editing of static
types.
  That positions us to tackle collaboration with what could be called version
control for structure editing. We present a theory realizing this idea, which
is our main technical contribution. While we focus here on editing types, if we
can extend the approach to cover the entire programming experience then it
would offer a new way to collaborate in image-based programming.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格是一种广泛使用的编程环境，在金融等领域有着广泛的应用，在这些领域中错误可能导致灾难性后果，因此需要一种查找电子表格公式错误的方法。

Method: 提出了一种专门用于查找电子表格公式错误、直接利用电子表格矩形特性并使用信息论方法来识别那些破坏附近矩形区域的意外公式的静态分析方法。

Result: ExceLint 速度快且有效，在一个包含 70 个电子表格的语料库中，ExceLint 处理每个电子表格的中位时间为 5 秒，并且其性能显著优于最先进的分析。

Conclusion: ExceLint 速度快且有效，在一个包含 70 个电子表格的语料库中，ExceLint 处理每个电子表格的中位时间为 5 秒，并且其性能显著优于最先进的分析。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are one of the most widely used programming environments, and
are widely deployed in domains like finance where errors can have catastrophic
consequences. We present a static analysis specifically designed to find
spreadsheet formula errors. Our analysis directly leverages the rectangular
character of spreadsheets. It uses an information-theoretic approach to
identify formulas that are especially surprising disruptions to nearby
rectangular regions. We present ExceLint, an implementation of our static
analysis for Microsoft Excel. We demonstrate that ExceLint is fast and
effective: across a corpus of 70 spreadsheets, ExceLint takes a median of 5
seconds per spreadsheet, and it significantly outperforms the state of the art
analysis.

### [60] [Synthesizing Bijective Lenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03248)
*Anders Miltner,Kathleen Fisher,Benjamin C. Pierce,David Walker,Steve Zdancewic*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: Optician tool synthesizes bidirectional string transformers efficiently using type-directed synthesis, improving upon manual methods and complex DSLs by leveraging regular expression equivalences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually building bidirectional transformations is tedious and error-prone. Existing domain-specific languages can be difficult to program in due to fiddly details and complex type systems.

Method: Optician synthesizes bidirectional string transformers by taking two regular expressions and a few examples as input, generating a well-typed program in the bidirectional language Boomerang. The core technical challenge is efficiently navigating the program search space, which is addressed by operating within a language with a rich equivalence relation on types and synthesizing terms in an equivalent language before converting them to the lens language.

Result: Optician solves the synthesis problem by transforming it from one admitting intractable solutions to one admitting highly efficient solutions, as demonstrated empirically on a benchmark suite of 39 examples, including realistic examples from Flash Fill and Augeas.

Conclusion: We present Optician, a tool for type-directed synthesis of bijective string transformers, which navigates the vast program search space efficiently using a rich equivalence relation on types and demonstrates empirical efficiency improvements on a benchmark suite.

Abstract: Bidirectional transformations between different data representations occur
frequently in modern software systems. They appear as serializers and
deserializers, as database views and view updaters, and more. Manually building
bidirectional transformations---by writing two separate functions that are
intended to be inverses---is tedious and error prone. A better approach is to
use a domain-specific language in which both directions can be written as a
single expression. However, these domain-specific languages can be difficult to
program in, requiring programmers to manage fiddly details while working in a
complex type system.
  To solve this, we present Optician, a tool for type-directed synthesis of
bijective string transformers. The inputs to Optician are two ordinary regular
expressions representing two data formats and a few concrete examples for
disambiguation. The output is a well-typed program in Boomerang (a
bidirectional language based on the theory of lenses). The main technical
challenge involves navigating the vast program search space efficiently enough.
Unlike most prior work on type-directed synthesis, our system operates in the
context of a language with a rich equivalence relation on types (the theory of
regular expressions). We synthesize terms of a equivalent language and convert
those generated terms into our lens language. We prove the correctness of our
synthesis algorithm. We also demonstrate empirically that our new language
changes the synthesis problem from one that admits intractable solutions to one
that admits highly efficient solutions. We evaluate Optician on a benchmark
suite of 39 examples including both microbenchmarks and realistic examples
derived from other data management systems including Flash Fill, a tool for
synthesizing string transformations in spreadsheets, and Augeas, a tool for
bidirectional processing of Linux system configuration files.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种名为AUTOGRAM的方法，可以从少量样本输入中学习程序的输入语法，生成准确易读的语法，并直接用于自动化测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了对程序进行系统性测试，需要了解其精确的输入格式。

Method: 通过跟踪数据流、聚合输入片段、分配标识符以及使用成员查询来泛化产生规则，从而系统地学习输入语法。

Result: 在对URL、电子表格和配置文件等输入进行评估时，AUTOGRAM原型生成的输入语法准确且非常易读，可以直接被测试生成器用于全面的自动化测试。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成准确且易于阅读的输入语法，并可直接用于测试生成。

Abstract: Knowing the precise format of a program's input is a necessary prerequisite
for systematic testing. Given a program and a small set of sample inputs, we
(1) track the data flow of inputs to aggregate input fragments that share the
same data flow through program execution into lexical and syntactic entities;
(2) assign these entities names that are based on the associated variable and
function identifiers; and (3) systematically generalize production rules by
means of membership queries. As a result, we need only a minimal set of sample
inputs to obtain human-readable context-free grammars that reflect valid input
structure. In our evaluation on inputs like URLs, spreadsheets, or
configuration files, our AUTOGRAM prototype obtains input grammars that are
both accurate and very readable - and that can be directly fed into test
generators for comprehensive automated testing.

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为DACE的新技术，利用编程by-example和DSL（结合空间/关系推理）以及基于FTA的版本空间学习算法，自动完成表格数据补全任务，解决了用户在编程方面的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决数据补全任务中，非专业用户（如终端用户和数据科学家）在需要编程专业知识时遇到的困难。

Method: 提出了一种结合编程by-example（PBE）和轻量级草图的方法，用于自动化数据补全任务。该方法使用领域特定语言（DSL）结合空间和关系推理，并采用基于有限树自动机（FTA）的新型合成算法来生成与输入输出示例一致的DSL程序。

Result: 在84个基准测试中实现了自动化数据补全，并与PROSE和SKETCH两种现有合成器进行了比较，展示了该方法的优势。

Conclusion: 该技术通过结合编程by-example（PBE）和一种轻量级的草图方法，能够自动执行数据补全任务。它使用领域特定语言（DSL）结合空间和关系推理，并通过基于有限树自动机（FTA）的版本空间学习算法来合成程序。

Abstract: In application domains that store data in a tabular format, a common task is
to fill the values of some cells using values stored in other cells. For
instance, such data completion tasks arise in the context of missing value
imputation in data science and derived data computation in spreadsheets and
relational databases. Unfortunately, end-users and data scientists typically
struggle with many data completion tasks that require non-trivial programming
expertise. This paper presents a synthesis technique for automating data
completion tasks using programming-by-example (PBE) and a very lightweight
sketching approach. Given a formula sketch (e.g., AVG($?_1$, $?_2$)) and a few
input-output examples for each hole, our technique synthesizes a program to
automate the desired data completion task. Towards this goal, we propose a
domain-specific language (DSL) that combines spatial and relational reasoning
over tabular data and a novel synthesis algorithm that can generate DSL
programs that are consistent with the input-output examples. The key technical
novelty of our approach is a new version space learning algorithm that is based
on finite tree automata (FTA). The use of FTAs in the learning algorithm leads
to a more compact representation that allows more sharing between programs that
are consistent with the examples. We have implemented the proposed approach in
a tool called DACE and evaluate it on 84 benchmarks taken from online help
forums. We also illustrate the advantages of our approach by comparing our
technique against two existing synthesizers, namely PROSE and SKETCH.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI应该关注实体及其关系，而不是像素或词语。虽然最有价值的数据是关系型的，但关系学习并未占据主导地位。本文将探讨原因并提出解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统应关注对实体（包括事件、物体、事物）及其属性和关系进行建模，而不是对感知或描述进行建模。最有价值的数据是以文本和图像形式存在的，但实际最有价值的数据是以电子表格、数据库和其他关系格式存在的。

Method: 解释了关系学习为何没有占据主导地位，以及需要做什么。

Result: 关系学习在某些受限情况下取得了一定的成功，但并未普及。AI系统应更多地关注关系学习，以充分利用有价值的数据。

Conclusion: 关系学习并未占据主导地位，除非在关系受限的情况下。需要采取措施来提升其地位。

Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words,
and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes
but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and
relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or
description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and
pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text
and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most
valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These
are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are
full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other
identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that
studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,
statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational
learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted
relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

TL;DR: MMTU是一个包含30K+问题和25个真实世界表格任务的大型基准测试，用于评估模型在表格数据上的专家级理解、推理和操作能力。当前模型表现不佳，凸显了在该领域进一步发展的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自然语言处理基准测试虽然广泛，但针对表格相关任务的评估却有限，并且过于关注自然语言到SQL和表格问答等特定任务，忽略了专业用户在实际应用中所面临的更广泛的任务。这种不足限制了对模型能力在这一重要领域的理解和进展。

Method: MMTU基准测试的设计包含了来自数十年关于表格数据的计算机科学研究的复杂表格任务，专注于专业用户面临的挑战。通过在MMTU上评估包括OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1在内的模型，展示了它们在表格理解、推理和编码等方面的能力局限性。

Result: 现有前沿模型（如OpenAI o4-mini和DeepSeek R1）在MMTU基准测试上的得分仅为60%左右，表明在表格理解、推理和编码等综合技能方面仍有很大的改进空间。

Conclusion: MMTU是一个大规模的基准测试，包含30K以上的问题和25个现实世界的表格任务，旨在全面评估模型在专家级别上理解、推理和操作真实表格的能力。该基准测试揭示了当今前沿模型在处理表格数据方面仍存在显著的提升空间。

Abstract: Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many important
real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational
notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers,
data analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown
remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database
copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains
limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,
evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like
NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks
that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model
progress in this important area.
  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K
questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively
evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at
the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science
research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by
professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills --
including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging
for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI
o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for
improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope
that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing
foundation models for structured data processing and analysis. Our code and

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new reinforcement learning framework called Formula Tuning (Fortune) trains language models to generate spreadsheet formulas for answering questions about data in tables. This approach improves the models' ability to perform complex calculations and reasoning, even outperforming larger models on certain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large language models struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic reasoning over tabular data, despite the expressiveness of spreadsheet formulas for encoding reasoning patterns.

Method: Formula Tuning (Fortune) is a reinforcement learning framework that trains LMs to generate spreadsheet formulas for table question answering. It uses binary answer correctness as a reward signal.

Result: Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM performance on table understanding, especially on multi-step reasoning tasks, outperforming a larger model (OpenAI o1) with a 7B parameter model. This demonstrates the potential of formula-driven RL for symbolic table reasoning.

Conclusion: Formula Tuning (Fortune) framework uses reinforcement learning to train LMs to generate executable spreadsheet formulas for question answering over tabular data. It reduces the need for supervised annotations by using answer correctness as a reward signal, improving performance on complex numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Tables are a fundamental structure for organizing and analyzing data, making
effective table understanding a critical capability for intelligent systems.
While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning
abilities, they continue to struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic
reasoning over tabular data, especially in complex scenarios. Spreadsheet
formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable
symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely
underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable
spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula
Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary
answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula
derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its
advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on
seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM
performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks,
enabling a 7B model to outperform OpenAI o1 on table understanding. This
highlights the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table
reasoning in LMs.

Method: 通过系统性地审查43个AI风险分类法，并进行专家咨询，构建了一个包含777个风险的数据库，并根据因果因素（实体、意图、时序）和七个风险领域（歧视与毒性、隐私与安全、错误信息、恶意行为者与滥用、人机交互、社会经济与环境、AI系统安全、故障与限制）进行了分类。

Abstract: The risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) are of considerable concern
to academics, auditors, policymakers, AI companies, and the public. However, a
lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to
comprehensively discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this
gap by creating an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference.
This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies,
which can be filtered based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed,
modified, and updated via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our
Repository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured
classifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our
taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level
Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1)
Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3)
Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI
Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination &
toxicity, (2) Privacy & security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors &
misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic & environmental, and
(7) AI system safety, failures, & limitations. These are further divided into
23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt
to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly
accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This
creates a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to
defining, auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.

TL;DR: SpreadsheetLLM通过创新的SheetCompressor编码框架和Chain of Spreadsheet方法，显著提升了LLM在电子表格理解、表格检测和问答任务上的表现和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在理解和处理电子表格时遇到的挑战，例如其二维网格、灵活布局和多样的格式。

Method: 提出了一种名为SheetCompressor的编码框架，包含基于结构锚的压缩、逆向索引转换和数据格式感知聚合三个模块，并结合Chain of Spreadsheet。

Result: SheetCompressor相比基础方法在电子表格表格检测任务上提升了25.6%（在GPT4的上下文学习设置下）。经过SheetCompressor微调的LLM实现了25倍的平均压缩率，并在电子表格问答任务上达到了78.9%的F1分数，超越现有模型12.3%。

Conclusion: SpreadsheetLLM在多种电子表格任务中表现出高效性，通过Chain of Spreadsheet能够有效处理电子表格理解和问答任务。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are characterized by their extensive two-dimensional grids,
flexible layouts, and varied formatting options, which pose significant
challenges for large language models (LLMs). In response, we introduce
SpreadsheetLLM, pioneering an efficient encoding method designed to unleash and
optimize LLMs' powerful understanding and reasoning capability on spreadsheets.
Initially, we propose a vanilla serialization approach that incorporates cell
addresses, values, and formats. However, this approach was limited by LLMs'
token constraints, making it impractical for most applications. To tackle this
challenge, we develop SheetCompressor, an innovative encoding framework that
compresses spreadsheets effectively for LLMs. It comprises three modules:
structural-anchor-based compression, inverse index translation, and
data-format-aware aggregation. It significantly improves performance in the
spreadsheet table detection task, outperforming the vanilla approach by 25.6%
in GPT4's in-context learning setting. Moreover, fine-tuned LLM with
SheetCompressor has an average compression ratio of 25 times, and achieves a
state-of-the-art 78.9% F1 score, surpassing the best existing models by 12.3%.
Finally, we propose Chain of Spreadsheet for downstream tasks of spreadsheet
understanding and validate it in a new and demanding spreadsheet QA task. We
methodically leverage the inherent layout and structure of spreadsheets,
demonstrating that SpreadsheetLLM is highly effective across a variety of
spreadsheet tasks.

Abstract: Spreadsheets are ubiquitous across the World Wide Web, playing a critical
role in enhancing work efficiency across various domains. Large language model
(LLM) has been recently attempted for automatic spreadsheet manipulation but
has not yet been investigated in complicated and realistic tasks where
reasoning challenges exist (e.g., long horizon manipulation with multi-step
reasoning and ambiguous requirements). To bridge the gap with the real-world
requirements, we introduce SheetRM, a benchmark featuring long-horizon and
multi-category tasks with reasoning-dependent manipulation caused by real-life
challenges. To mitigate the above challenges, we further propose SheetAgent, a
novel autonomous agent that utilizes the power of LLMs. SheetAgent consists of
three collaborative modules: Planner, Informer, and Retriever, achieving both
advanced reasoning and accurate manipulation over spreadsheets without human
interaction through iterative task reasoning and reflection. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SheetAgent delivers 20--40\% pass rate
improvements on multiple benchmarks over baselines, achieving enhanced
precision in spreadsheet manipulation and demonstrating superior table
reasoning abilities. More details and visualizations are available at the
project website: https://sheetagent.github.io/. The datasets and source code
are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SheetAgent.

### [71] [FormaT5: Abstention and Examples for Conditional Table Formatting with Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17306)
*Mukul Singh,José Cambronero,Sumit Gulwani,Vu Le,Carina Negreanu,Elnaz Nouri,Mohammad Raza,Gust Verbruggen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FormaT5是一个能根据自然语言描述生成电子表格条件格式化规则的AI模型。它通过预测和填充占位符来解决用户描述不清晰的问题，并在包含真实世界场景的基准测试中表现出色，超越了其他AI方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格软件中的条件格式化（CF）功能对于数据可视化、呈现和分析至关重要，但用户编写CF规则往往很困难，因为需要理解和实现底层逻辑。用户对这些任务的描述常常不完全或模棱两可，使得代码生成系统难以一步准确地学习所需的规则。

Method: FormaT5是一个基于Transformer的模型，它接收目标表格和自然语言描述，并生成条件格式化规则。为了处理不完全指定和歧义的用户描述，FormaT5学会预测占位符，然后由第二个模型或编程示例系统来填写这些占位符。

Result: FormaT5通过其占位符预测和填充机制，在包含1053个条件格式化任务的广泛基准测试中，优于8种不同的神经方法，无论是否有示例数据。

Conclusion: FormaT5通过引入占位符和使用两种模型（一个用于预测占位符，另一个用于填写占位符）来解决条件格式化规则生成中的不完全指定和歧义问题。该模型在包含1053个条件格式化任务的基准测试中，优于8种不同的神经方法，证明了构建特定领域学习系统的价值。

Abstract: Formatting is an important property in tables for visualization,
presentation, and analysis. Spreadsheet software allows users to automatically
format their tables by writing data-dependent conditional formatting (CF)
rules. Writing such rules is often challenging for users as it requires them to
understand and implement the underlying logic. We present FormaT5, a
transformer-based model that can generate a CF rule given the target table and
a natural language description of the desired formatting logic. We find that
user descriptions for these tasks are often under-specified or ambiguous,
making it harder for code generation systems to accurately learn the desired
rule in a single step. To tackle this problem of under-specification and
minimise argument errors, FormaT5 learns to predict placeholders though an
abstention objective. These placeholders can then be filled by a second model
or, when examples of rows that should be formatted are available, by a
programming-by-example system. To evaluate FormaT5 on diverse and real
scenarios, we create an extensive benchmark of 1053 CF tasks, containing
real-world descriptions collected from four different sources. We release our
benchmarks to encourage research in this area. Abstention and filling allow
FormaT5 to outperform 8 different neural approaches on our benchmarks, both
with and without examples. Our results illustrate the value of building
domain-specific learning systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Model-based diagnosis is a versatile troubleshooting approach for complex modern systems, aiming to minimize failure impact by detecting, localizing, and fixing faults using a combination of AI and mathematical techniques. This thesis explores its challenges and solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern systems are highly sophisticated and essential for everyday life, but their complexity leads to potential failures with significant negative impacts. Therefore, minimizing downtime and repair costs through effective fault management is crucial.

Method: Model-based diagnosis leverages various techniques like knowledge representation, automated reasoning, heuristic problem solving, intelligent search, optimization, stochastics, statistics, decision making under uncertainty, machine learning, calculus, combinatorics, and set theory to detect, localize, and fix faults in malfunctioning systems.

Result: The thesis provides an overview of model-based diagnosis and presents research-based solutions to major challenges in the field.

Conclusion: The thesis introduces model-based diagnosis, highlights key challenges, and discusses research approaches to address them.

Abstract: In the modern world, we are permanently using, leveraging, interacting with,
and relying upon systems of ever higher sophistication, ranging from our cars,
recommender systems in e-commerce, and networks when we go online, to
integrated circuits when using our PCs and smartphones, the power grid to
ensure our energy supply, security-critical software when accessing our bank
accounts, and spreadsheets for financial planning and decision making. The
complexity of these systems coupled with our high dependency on them implies
both a non-negligible likelihood of system failures, and a high potential that
such failures have significant negative effects on our everyday life. For that
reason, it is a vital requirement to keep the harm of emerging failures to a
minimum, which means minimizing the system downtime as well as the cost of
system repair. This is where model-based diagnosis comes into play.
  Model-based diagnosis is a principled, domain-independent approach that can
be generally applied to troubleshoot systems of a wide variety of types,
including all the ones mentioned above, and many more. It exploits and
orchestrates i.a. techniques for knowledge representation, automated reasoning,
heuristic problem solving, intelligent search, optimization, stochastics,
statistics, decision making under uncertainty, machine learning, as well as
calculus, combinatorics and set theory to detect, localize, and fix faults in
abnormally behaving systems.
  In this thesis, we will give an introduction to the topic of model-based
diagnosis, point out the major challenges in the field, and discuss a selection
of approaches from our research addressing these issues.

### [73] [CORNET: Learning Table Formatting Rules By Example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06032)
*Mukul Singh,José Cambronero,Sumit Gulwani,Vu Le,Carina Negreanu,Mohammad Raza,Gust Verbruggen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CORNET learns spreadsheet formatting rules from examples, outperforming other methods and finding more concise rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Writing stylistic formatting rules in spreadsheets is challenging for users due to the need for knowledge of rule languages and data logic. CORNET aims to automate this process.

Method: CORNET combines symbolic rule enumeration with a neural ranker to learn conditional formatting rules from user-provided examples (formatted cells).

Result: CORNET accurately learns rules, finds shorter rules than users write, and discovers rules in manually formatted spreadsheets. It was evaluated on over 450K unique formatting rules extracted from 1.8M worksheets.

Conclusion: CORNET can accurately learn formatting rules across different evaluation settings, discover shorter rules than human-written ones, and identify rules in manually formatted spreadsheets.

Abstract: Spreadsheets are widely used for table manipulation and presentation.
Stylistic formatting of these tables is an important property for both
presentation and analysis. As a result, popular spreadsheet software, such as
Excel, supports automatically formatting tables based on rules. Unfortunately,
writing such formatting rules can be challenging for users as it requires
knowledge of the underlying rule language and data logic. We present CORNET, a
system that tackles the novel problem of automatically learning such formatting
rules from user examples in the form of formatted cells. CORNET takes
inspiration from advances in inductive programming and combines symbolic rule
enumeration with a neural ranker to learn conditional formatting rules. To
motivate and evaluate our approach, we extracted tables with over 450K unique
formatting rules from a corpus of over 1.8M real worksheets. Since we are the
first to introduce conditional formatting, we compare CORNET to a wide range of
symbolic and neural baselines adapted from related domains. Our results show
that CORNET accurately learns rules across varying evaluation setups.
Additionally, we show that CORNET finds shorter rules than those that a user
has written and discovers rules in spreadsheets that users have manually
formatted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of applications of table transformers in industry, specifically for Named Entity Recognition (NER) on tabular-structured spreadsheets, despite the prevalence of tabular data in industry.

Method: A dedicated table data augmentation strategy using domain-specific knowledge graphs was developed and applied to a table transformer model. The performance was compared against other baselines, investigating the benefits of tabular structure versus linearized sequences.

Result: The table transformer model significantly outperformed other baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of the augmentation strategy in a low-resource scenario and highlighting the importance of the tabular inductive bias for convergence.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models can be successfully applied to industrial NER problems on tabular data, especially when augmented with domain-specific knowledge graphs. The tabular structure provides a vital inductive bias for model convergence.

Abstract: Specialized transformer-based models for encoding tabular data have gained
interest in academia. Although tabular data is omnipresent in industry,
applications of table transformers are still missing. In this paper, we study
how these models can be applied to an industrial Named Entity Recognition (NER)
problem where the entities are mentioned in tabular-structured spreadsheets.
The highly technical nature of spreadsheets as well as the lack of labeled data
present major challenges for fine-tuning transformer-based models. Therefore,
we develop a dedicated table data augmentation strategy based on available
domain-specific knowledge graphs. We show that this boosts performance in our
low-resource scenario considerably. Further, we investigate the benefits of
tabular structure as inductive bias compared to tables as linearized sequences.
Our experiments confirm that a table transformer outperforms other baselines
and that its tabular inductive bias is vital for convergence of
transformer-based models.

TL;DR: Spreadsheets can now solve complex problems beyond simple bookkeeping by incorporating a constraint solver, making them more powerful for non-programmers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spreadsheet applications are popular due to their ease of use but are limited to bookkeeping-like tasks because of their single-direction data flow. This thesis aims to extend the paradigm to handle more complex problems like constraint satisfaction.

Method: A framework is presented that seamlessly incorporates a finite constraint solver with the spreadsheet computing paradigm. Cells can be attached to finite domains or constraints, and the framework provides an interface for constraint solving and spreadsheet-specific constraints to manage scalability.

Result: The extended spreadsheet paradigm enhances usability and usefulness by allowing non-programmers to solve constraint satisfaction problems in a familiar spreadsheet setting, with examples provided to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This thesis demonstrates an extension of the spreadsheet computing paradigm to overcome the limitation of single-direction data flow, enabling the solution of constraint satisfaction problems by incorporating a finite constraint solver.

Abstract: Spreadsheet computing is one of the more popular computing methodologies in
today's modern society. The spreadsheet application's ease of use and
usefulness has enabled non-programmers to perform programming-like tasks in a
familiar setting modeled after the tabular "pen and paper" approach. However,
spreadsheet applications are limited to bookkeeping-like tasks due to their
single-direction data flow. This thesis demonstrates an extension of the
spreadsheet computing paradigm in overcoming this limitation to solve
constraint satisfaction problems. We present a framework seamlessly
incorporating a finite constraint solver with the spreadsheet computing
paradigm. This framework allows the individual cells in the spreadsheet to be
attached to either a finite domain or a constraint specifying the relationship
among the cells. The framework provides an interface for constraint solving and
further enhances the spreadsheet computing paradigm by providing a set of
spreadsheet-specific constraints that will aid in controlling the scalability
of large spreadsheet applications implementations. Finally, we provide examples
to demonstrate the usability and usefulness of the extended spreadsheet
paradigm.

Conclusion: 通过UI日志分析和数据转换发现技术，实现了自动化重复性数据传输例程。

Abstract: Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a technology for automating repetitive
routines consisting of sequences of user interactions with one or more
applications. In order to fully exploit the opportunities opened by RPA,
companies need to discover which specific routines may be automated, and how.
In this setting, this paper addresses the problem of analyzing User Interaction
(UI) logs in order to discover routines where a user transfers data from one
spreadsheet or (Web) form to another. The paper maps this problem to that of
discovering data transformations by example - a problem for which several
techniques are available. The paper shows that a naive application of a
state-of-the-art technique for data transformation discovery is computationally
inefficient. Accordingly, the paper proposes two optimizations that take
advantage of the information in the UI log and the fact that data transfers
across applications typically involve copying alphabetic and numeric tokens
separately. The proposed approach and its optimizations are evaluated using UI
logs that replicate a real-life repetitive data transfer routine.

Conclusion: 提出了一种名为神经引导归纳搜索（NGDS）的混合合成技术，该技术结合了符号逻辑技术和统计模型，能够生成满足给定规范且泛化能力强的程序，并在真实客户场景中实现了高达12倍的速度提升。

Abstract: Synthesizing user-intended programs from a small number of input-output
examples is a challenging problem with several important applications like
spreadsheet manipulation, data wrangling and code refactoring. Existing
synthesis systems either completely rely on deductive logic techniques that are
extensively hand-engineered or on purely statistical models that need massive
amounts of data, and in general fail to provide real-time synthesis on
challenging benchmarks. In this work, we propose Neural Guided Deductive Search
(NGDS), a hybrid synthesis technique that combines the best of both symbolic
logic techniques and statistical models. Thus, it produces programs that
satisfy the provided specifications by construction and generalize well on
unseen examples, similar to data-driven systems. Our technique effectively
utilizes the deductive search framework to reduce the learning problem of the
neural component to a simple supervised learning setup. Further, this allows us
to both train on sparingly available real-world data and still leverage
powerful recurrent neural network encoders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method by evaluating on real-world customer scenarios by synthesizing
accurate programs with up to 12x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Motivation: 许多政府机构在智慧城市倡议下，需要公开其数据，包括城市范围传感器网络的测量数据。然而，这些数据通常以电子表格、CSV文件、PDF或Word文档等形式发布，给数据使用者带来了重用上的困难，例如文件格式不兼容或难以理解数据含义。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种利用人类感知传感器网络本体（HASNetO）来管理城市环境中收集的数据和元数据的方法，并以巴西福塔雷萨市为例进行了讨论。

Abstract: As part of Smart Cities initiatives, national, regional and local governments
all over the globe are under the mandate of being more open regarding how they
share their data. Under this mandate, many of these governments are publishing
data under the umbrella of open government data, which includes measurement
data from city-wide sensor networks. Furthermore, many of these data are
published in so-called data portals as documents that may be spreadsheets,
comma-separated value (CSV) data files, or plain documents in PDF or Word
documents. The sharing of these documents may be a convenient way for the data
provider to convey and publish data but it is not the ideal way for data
consumers to reuse the data. For example, the problems of reusing the data may
range from difficulty opening a document that is provided in any format that is
not plain text, to the actual problem of understanding the meaning of each
piece of knowledge inside of the document. Our proposal tackles those
challenges by identifying metadata that has been regarded to be relevant for
measurement data and providing a schema for this metadata. We further leverage
the Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology (HASNetO) to build an architecture for
data collected in urban environments. We discuss the use of HASNetO and the
supporting infrastructure to manage both data and metadata in support of the
City of Fortaleza, a large metropolitan area in Brazil.

Motivation: 为了弥补传统基于邮件头信息提取的社交网络分析方法忽略了附件数据导致信息丢失的缺点，并假设附件共享能更真实地反映用户间关系的亲密度和数据量。通过分析附件数据，旨在更深入地揭示邮件档案的社交结构。

Method: 从Enron邮件语料库中提取通信网络和共享附件网络，并分析了两种网络中的度、中介中心性、紧密度和特征向量中心性等指标。此外，研究还使用最近邻算法生成了相似度分组，并与Enron员工的组织结构进行了比对。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了使用共享附件作为用户间通信的边的社交网络分析方法，并对Enron邮件语料库进行了分析。结果表明，与传统方法相比，这种新方法能提供更深入的社交结构洞察，并且通过与组织结构的对比验证了其有效性。

Abstract: There is an extensive body of research on Social Network Analysis (SNA) based
on the email archive. The network used in the analysis is generally extracted
either by capturing the email communication in From, To, Cc and Bcc email
header fields or by the entities contained in the email message. In the latter
case, the entities could be, for instance, the bag of words, url's, names,
phones, etc. It could also include the textual content of attachments, for
instance Microsoft Word documents, excel spreadsheets, or Adobe pdfs. The nodes
in this network represent users and entities. The edges represent communication
between users and relations to the entities. We suggest taking a different
approach to the network extraction and use attachments shared between users as
the edges. The motivation for this is two-fold. First, attachments represent
the "intimacy" manifestation of the relation's strength. Second, the
statistical analysis of private email archives that we collected and Enron
email corpus shows that the attachments contribute in average around 80-90% to
the archive's disk-space usage, which means that most of the data is presently
ignored in the SNA of email archives. Consequently, we hypothesize that this
approach might provide more insight into the social structure of the email
archive. We extract the communication and shared attachments networks from
Enron email corpus. We further analyze degree, betweenness, closeness, and
eigenvector centrality measures in both networks and review the differences and
what can be learned from them. We use nearest neighbor algorithm to generate
similarity groups for five Enron employees. The groups are consistent with
Enron's organizational chart, which validates our approach.

TL;DR: Catenary concept can reduce wellbore friction, needs more analysis. A case study compares it to 2D Arc design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wellbore friction is a major concern in drilling due to its impact on cost. The catenary concept was introduced to mitigate this, but it lacks detailed analysis.

Method: A case study comparing Catenary Trajectory Design with traditional 2D Arc design was introduced. Calculation procedures for both methods are available in an MS Excel spreadsheet.

Result: The project aims to examine the outcome of Catenary Trajectory Design versus traditional 2D Arc design in reducing wellbore friction.

Conclusion: The catenary concept can potentially reduce wellbore friction, but requires further detailed analysis and design.

Abstract: Wellbore friction is one of the biggest concerns when drilling due to its
relation to the total cost. The catenary concept was introduced to reduce
wellbore friction, but it requires detailed analyses. This project would fill
this gap. A catenary shape is simply the natural shape of a rope, chain, or
drill string. The drill string will then hang freely inside the wellbore.
Perfectly, there should be no contact between the hole and the string, and thus
no friction. Torque and drag should be minimized this way. A case study is
introduced to examine the outcome between Catenary Trajectory Design and
traditional 2D Arc design. The calculation procedure of Catenary Trajectory and
2D Arc Design can be found in an MS Excel spreadsheet which is easy to use and
reliable for designing catenary well trajectories for extended-reach wells.

TL;DR: 一种结合形式化方法和仿真，用于安全关键系统危险分析的两层方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决日益复杂的系统和传统基于推理、经验和简单工具的危险分析方法的局限性，以及测试方法的高成本和危险性。

Method: 提出了一种两层方法，首先使用监督控制理论从形式化模型综合不安全行为，然后将结果输入仿真，以进行详细的、使用领域特定风险度量的分析。

Result: 通过形式化方法和仿真相结合，实现了对安全关键系统的更全面和详细的危险分析。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了形式化方法和仿真的优点，适用于多种场景，并通过人机协作系统进行了演示。

Abstract: Safety critical systems are typically subjected to hazard analysis before
commissioning to identify and analyse potentially hazardous system states that
may arise during operation. Currently, hazard analysis is mainly based on human
reasoning, past experiences, and simple tools such as checklists and
spreadsheets. Increasing system complexity makes such approaches decreasingly
suitable. Furthermore, testing-based hazard analysis is often not suitable due
to high costs or dangers of physical faults. A remedy for this are model-based
hazard analysis methods, which either rely on formal models or on simulation
models, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. This paper proposes a
two-layer approach that combines the benefits of exhaustive analysis using
formal methods with detailed analysis using simulation. Unsafe behaviours that
lead to unsafe states are first synthesised from a formal model of the system
using Supervisory Control Theory. The result is then input to the simulation
where detailed analyses using domain-specific risk metrics are performed.
Though the presented approach is generally applicable, this paper demonstrates
the benefits of the approach on an industrial human-robot collaboration system.

### [83] [FORTAP: Using Formulas for Numerical-Reasoning-Aware Table Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07323)
*Zhoujun Cheng,Haoyu Dong,Ran Jia,Pengfei Wu,Shi Han,Fan Cheng,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FORTAP是一种新颖的表格预训练方法，它利用电子表格公式来增强数值推理能力，并在下游任务中取得了领先的成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格存储丰富的数值数据，但对表格进行数值推理仍然是一个挑战。我们发现，执行计算的电子表格公式是对数值推理的自然监督。更重要的是，网络上有大量的包含专家制作公式的电子表格，并且可以轻松获得。

Method: FORTAP是第一个利用大型电子表格公式语料库进行数值推理感知表预训练的方法。我们设计了两个公式预训练任务，以明确指导FORTAP学习半结构化表中的数值引用和计算。

Result: FORTAP在两个代表性下游任务（单元格类型分类和公式预测）上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: FORTAP在两个代表性下游任务（单元格类型分类和公式预测）上取得了最先进的结果，显示了数值推理感知预训练的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Tables store rich numerical data, but numerical reasoning over tables is
still a challenge. In this paper, we find that the spreadsheet formula, which
performs calculations on numerical values in tables, is naturally a strong
supervision of numerical reasoning. More importantly, large amounts of
spreadsheets with expert-made formulae are available on the web and can be
obtained easily. FORTAP is the first method for numerical-reasoning-aware table
pretraining by leveraging large corpus of spreadsheet formulae. We design two
formula pretraining tasks to explicitly guide FORTAP to learn numerical
reference and calculation in semi-structured tables. FORTAP achieves
state-of-the-art results on two representative downstream tasks, cell type
classification and formula prediction, showing great potential of
numerical-reasoning-aware pretraining.

*Gerardo Vitagliano,Lan Jiang,Felix Naumann*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Mondrian 是一种新方法，可以自动识别电子表格中的布局模板，并从单个文件中提取相应的区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格常用于数据管理、分发和分析，但其灵活的画布结构给自动化分析带来了挑战，尤其是当单个电子表格包含多个、由空单元格分隔的独立区域时（即“多区域”文件）。

Method: Mondrian 方法包含三个阶段：1. 将电子表格渲染成图像并检查可能构成区域的元素；2. 使用聚类算法将识别出的元素分组形成区域；3. 将每个文件布局表示为图并进行比较以查找布局模板。

Result: Mondrian 方法在两个真实的企业电子表格语料库上进行了评估，与最先进的表格识别算法进行了比较。结果表明，该方法在检测每个文件内的可靠区域边界方面表现最佳，并能正确识别跨文件的重复布局。

Conclusion: Mondrian 方法在检测可靠的区域边界和跨文件识别重复布局方面表现优于最先进的表格识别算法。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are among the most commonly used file formats for data
management, distribution, and analysis. Their widespread employment makes it
easy to gather large collections of data, but their flexible canvas-based
structure makes automated analysis difficult without heavy preparation. One of
the common problems that practitioners face is the presence of multiple,
independent regions in a single spreadsheet, possibly separated by repeated
empty cells. We define such files as "multiregion" files. In collections of
various spreadsheets, we can observe that some share the same layout. We
present the Mondrian approach to automatically identify layout templates across
multiple files and systematically extract the corresponding regions. Our
approach is composed of three phases: first, each file is rendered as an image
and inspected for elements that could form regions; then, using a clustering
algorithm, the identified elements are grouped to form regions; finally, every
file layout is represented as a graph and compared with others to find layout
templates. We compare our method to state-of-the-art table recognition
algorithms on two corpora of real-world enterprise spreadsheets. Our approach
shows the best performances in detecting reliable region boundaries within each
file and can correctly identify recurring layouts across files.

TL;DR: TUTA是一个统一的预训练框架，用于理解通用结构化表，通过其新颖的结构感知机制在多个任务和数据集上取得了最先进的成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表理解方法主要关注关系表，而忽略了其他常见的表结构。本文旨在提出一个统一的预训练框架，用于理解通用结构化表。

Method: TUTA采用了一种统一的、基于树的结构（双维度坐标树）来描述通用结构化表的空间和层次信息，并结合了基于树的注意力和位置嵌入。此外，还设计了三种渐进式的预训练目标，以实现令牌、单元格和表级别的表示。

Result: TUTA在两个关键任务上都取得了最先进的成果，在五个广泛研究的数据集上均表现优异。

Conclusion: TUTA在单元格类型分类和表类型分类两个关键的表结构理解任务上取得了最先进的成果，在五个广泛研究的数据集上均表现优异。

Abstract: Tables are widely used with various structures to organize and present data.
Recent attempts on table understanding mainly focus on relational tables, yet
overlook to other common table structures. In this paper, we propose TUTA, a
unified pre-training architecture for understanding generally structured
tables. Noticing that understanding a table requires spatial, hierarchical, and
semantic information, we enhance transformers with three novel structure-aware
mechanisms. First, we devise a unified tree-based structure, called a
bi-dimensional coordinate tree, to describe both the spatial and hierarchical
information of generally structured tables. Upon this, we propose tree-based
attention and position embedding to better capture the spatial and hierarchical
information. Moreover, we devise three progressive pre-training objectives to
enable representations at the token, cell, and table levels. We pre-train TUTA
on a wide range of unlabeled web and spreadsheet tables and fine-tune it on two
critical tasks in the field of table structure understanding: cell type
classification and table type classification. Experiments show that TUTA is
highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art on five widely-studied datasets.

*Haoyu Dong,Shijie Liu,Shi Han,Zhouyu Fu,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: TableSense is a novel CNN-based framework for detecting tables in spreadsheets, achieving high accuracy by employing a unique cell featurization scheme, an enhanced CNN model, and an active learning approach for dataset creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of table structures and layouts in spreadsheets poses a challenge for automatic table detection, a crucial step in spreadsheet data intelligence.

Method: TableSense, an end-to-end framework using a cell featurization scheme, an enhanced CNN model for precise boundary detection, and an uncertainty metric for active learning-based smart sampling.

Result: The developed framework achieved 91.3% recall and 86.5% precision on the EoB-2 metric, demonstrating significant improvement over commodity spreadsheet tools and state-of-the-art computer vision CNNs. A training dataset of 22,176 tables from 10,220 sheets was efficiently built.

Conclusion: TableSense is highly effective for spreadsheet table detection, significantly outperforming existing methods with 91.3% recall and 86.5% precision on the EoB-2 metric.

Abstract: Spreadsheet table detection is the task of detecting all tables on a given
sheet and locating their respective ranges. Automatic table detection is a key
enabling technique and an initial step in spreadsheet data intelligence.
However, the detection task is challenged by the diversity of table structures
and table layouts on the spreadsheet. Considering the analogy between a cell
matrix as spreadsheet and a pixel matrix as image, and encouraged by the
successful application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in computer
vision, we have developed TableSense, a novel end-to-end framework for
spreadsheet table detection. First, we devise an effective cell featurization
scheme to better leverage the rich information in each cell; second, we develop
an enhanced convolutional neural network model for table detection to meet the
domain-specific requirement on precise table boundary detection; third, we
propose an effective uncertainty metric to guide an active learning based smart
sampling algorithm, which enables the efficient build-up of a training dataset
with 22,176 tables on 10,220 sheets with broad coverage of diverse table
structures and layouts. Our evaluation shows that TableSense is highly
effective with 91.3\% recall and 86.5\% precision in EoB-2 metric, a
significant improvement over both the current detection algorithm that are used
in commodity spreadsheet tools and state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks in computer vision.

TL;DR: This paper introduces and addresses the task of recommending related tables by computing the similarity between tables using a novel framework that represents table elements in multiple semantic spaces and combines them using a discriminative learning model. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a Wikipedia tables test collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to recommend related tables, which can be used to proactively provide users of spreadsheet programs with recommendations for related structured content on the Web.

Method: The approach hinges on the idea of representing table elements in multiple semantic spaces, and then combining element-level similarities using a discriminative learning model.

Result: The proposed approach delivers state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: We demonstrate that the proposed approach delivers state-of-the-art performance using a purpose-built test collection from Wikipedia tables.

Abstract: Tables are an extremely powerful visual and interactive tool for structuring
and manipulating data, making spreadsheet programs one of the most popular
computer applications. In this paper we introduce and address the task of
recommending related tables: given an input table, identifying and returning a
ranked list of relevant tables. One of the many possible application scenarios
for this task is to provide users of a spreadsheet program proactively with
recommendations for related structured content on the Web. At its core, the
related table recommendation task boils down to computing the similarity
between a pair of tables. We develop a theoretically sound framework for
performing table matching. Our approach hinges on the idea of representing
table elements in multiple semantic spaces, and then combining element-level
similarities using a discriminative learning model. Using a purpose-built test
collection from Wikipedia tables, we demonstrate that the proposed approach
delivers state-of-the-art performance.

namely, tables with an entity focus. We introduce and focus on two specific
tasks: populating rows with additional instances (entities) and populating
columns with new headings. We develop generative probabilistic models for both
tasks. For estimating the components of these models, we consider a knowledge
base as well as a large table corpus. Our experimental evaluation simulates the
various stages of the user entering content into an actual table. A detailed
analysis of the results shows that the models' components are complimentary and
that our methods outperform existing approaches from the literature.

*James P. Dilger*

Main category: math.HO

TL;DR: Wordle 玩家行为分析：发现“作弊”玩家、起始词偏好和外部影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了量化分析 Wordle 玩家的行为，揭示如“作弊”玩家比例、玩家对起始词的偏好和忠诚度，以及玩家易受外部信息影响等现象，超越了传统的社交媒体分析方法。

Method: 通过收集和分析 2023 年 5 月至 8 月的 Wordle 玩家起始猜测词数据，运用信息论评估玩家的运气和技巧。

Result: A) 每天约有 0.2%-0.5% 的玩家在一局游戏中解决 Wordle，远高于随机猜测的概率 (0.043%)，表明约有 4,000-10,000 名玩家可能通过非正常途径获取答案。B) 至少有 1/3 的玩家有自己偏好的起始词，并且即使在目标词出现后，玩家仍然倾向于继续使用他们偏好的起始词。C) 在 2023 年 8 月 15 日，约有 30,000 名玩家突然更换了他们的起始词，这可能与填字游戏线索有关，表明玩家的行为可能受到外部因素的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究通过分析 Wordle 玩家的起始猜测词数据，发现了玩家行为的几个有趣模式，包括“作弊”玩家的数量、玩家对起始词的偏好以及玩家易受外部信息影响的程度。

Abstract: Wordle is a popular, online word game offered by the New York Times
(nytimes.com). Currently there are some 2 million players of the English
version worldwide. Players have 6 attempts to guess the daily word (target
word) and after each attempt, the player receives color-coded information about
the correctness and position of each letter in the guess. After either a
successful completion of the puzzle or the final unsuccessful attempt, software
can assess the player's luck and skill using Information Theory and can display
data for the first, second, ..., sixth guesses of a random sample of all
players. Recently, I discovered that the latter data is presented in a format
that can easily be copied and pasted into a spreadsheet. I compiled data on
Wordle players' first guesses from May 2023 - August 2023 and inferred some
interesting information about Wordle players. A) Every day, about 0.2-0.5% of
players solve the puzzle in one attempt. Because the odds of guessing the one
of 2,315 possible target words at random is 0.043%, this implies that 4,000 -
10,000 players cheat by obtaining the target word outside of playing the game!
B) At least 1/3 of the players have a favorite starting word, or cycle through
several. And even though players should be aware that target words are never
repeated, most players appear to remain loyal to their starting word even after
its appearance as a target word. C) On August 15, 2023, about 30,000 players
abruptly changed their starting word, presumably based on a crossword puzzle
clue! Wordle players can be influenced! This study goes beyond social media
postings, surveys, and Google Trends to provide solid, quantitative evidence
about cheating in Wordle.

Abstract: In order to implement a STEAM approach including the use of technology,
namely the use of interactive mathematics software GeoGebra, in mathematics
classes, in the lusophone space, the materials presented here were conceived,
to be implemented in a first phase among teachers. Later, with the necessary
adaptations, these tasks will be applied to the students. The tasks deal with
modeling situations, in two- and three-dimensional geometric problems, in order
to apply GeoGebra software in its analysis to illustrate its capabilities. The
different windows of this software are used, namely the 2D and 3D windows, CAS
window, spreadsheet and extra two dimensional windows in order to study cutting
planes in solids and some surfaces. The tasks are presented so that any user,
regardless of the degree of knowledge they have of the software, can follow
them, being supported in scripts with some indications of the tools and
commands to use. Designed for the teaching and learning of Mathematics, from a
STEAM approach, these tasks allow connections with other Sciences and the Arts,
and allow the development of projects using and consolidating relevant
mathematical contents. These tasks are part of the proposals of activities of
the participants of the Training Courses for Trainers in GeoGebra for
Portuguese Speaking Countries, which from 2019 have an impact on the STEAM
approach. These courses are carried out with the high sponsorship of the
Organization of Ibero-American States for Education, Science and Culture (OEI).
Given the interest that the tasks have for the users of the Iberian space, as
well as their dissemination at a global level, the materials initially
developed in Portuguese language will be adapted for Spanish and English
speakers.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, ransomware
represents a significant challenge. Attackers increasingly employ sophisticated
encryption methods, such as entropy reduction through Base64 encoding, and
partial or intermittent encryption to evade traditional detection methods. This
study explores the dynamic battle between adversaries who continuously refine
encryption strategies and defenders developing advanced countermeasures to
protect vulnerable data. We investigate the application of online incremental
machine learning algorithms designed to predict file encryption activities
despite adversaries evolving obfuscation techniques. Our analysis utilizes an
extensive dataset of 32.6 GB, comprising 11,928 files across multiple formats,
including Microsoft Word documents (doc), PowerPoint presentations (ppt), Excel
spreadsheets (xlsx), image formats (jpg, jpeg, png, tif, gif), PDFs (pdf),
audio (mp3), and video (mp4) files. These files were encrypted by 75 distinct
ransomware families, facilitating a robust empirical evaluation of machine
learning classifiers effectiveness against diverse encryption tactics. Results
highlight the Hoeffding Tree algorithms superior incremental learning
capability, particularly effective in detecting traditional and AES-Base64
encryption methods employed to lower entropy. Conversely, the Random Forest
classifier with warm-start functionality excels at identifying intermittent
encryption methods, demonstrating the necessity of tailored machine learning
solutions to counter sophisticated ransomware strategies.

Motivation: 当前公司使用的Excel电子表格在库存记录和流程数据计算方面存在难以理解、跟踪困难以及易被随意更改或删除公式的风险。因此，有必要开发一个集中式应用程序来管理此数据，并协助操作员进行决策。

Method: 开发了一个实时库存分析应用程序，该应用程序使用C#编程语言，并集成了用于确定所需成分、可生产的成品数量以及优化成品数量的规划算法。

Result: 该应用程序能够识别生产所需数量的混合过程所需的成分，确定现有成分可生产的成品数量，以及优化成品数量。操作员可以通过该应用程序逐步构建结果。

Conclusion: 该应用程序利用C#和集成的规划算法，为用户提供了一个逐步构建结果的解决方案，有效解决了Excel电子表格在产品库存记录和流程数据计算中的不足。

Abstract: Many companies use Excel spreadsheets to keep stock records and to calculate
process-specific data. These spreadsheets are often hard to understand and
track. And if the user does not protect them, there is a risk that the user
randomly changes or erase formulas. The paper focuses on the stocks of products
used in a blending process with a known recipe. Developing an application that
can bring this data in a centralized form and that can assist the operator in
decide is a necessity. When a programmer implements an application that uses
data from plants he needs to consider one fundamental aspect as reading
real-time data from the process. The real-time stock analysis application takes
into account all the above elements. The application is easy to use by an
operator in the command room of installation because of the planning algorithms
integrated into it. The algorithms proposed and implemented in this paper have
well-defined goals: identifying the ingredients needed to achieve the blending
process for required quantities, determine the quantities of the finished
product that can be made with the existing ingredients and determine the
optimum quantities of the finished product. The application implemented in C#
intensively uses these algorithms and gives the user the ability to build the
result step by step.

Method: 通过网络抓取ESAC数据库中的1000多个合同的详细信息，并结合定性和定量方法对合同特征和TA格局进行深入分析。

Result: 研究发现，学术机构被困在变革性协议中，阻碍了向完全开放获取的过渡，并使传统出版商获得强大的市场力量，提高了进入壁垒，降低了竞争，增加了图书馆和大学的成本。

Conclusion: 学术机构似乎被困在变革性协议中，阻碍了向完全开放获取的过渡，并使传统出版商受益。

Abstract: Transformative agreements between academic publishers and research
institutions are ubiquitous. The 'Efficiency and Standards for Article Charges'
(ESAC) Initiative lists more than 1,000 contracts in its database. We make use
of this unique dataset by web-scraping the details of every contract to
substantially expand the overview spreadsheet provided by the ESAC Initiative.
Based on that hitherto unused data source, we combine qualitative and
quantitative methods to conduct an in-depth analysis of the contract
characteristics and the TA landscape. Our analysis demonstrates that research
institutions seem to be 'trapped' in transformative agreements. Instead of
being a bridge towards a fully Open Access world, academia is stuck in the
hybrid system. This endows the legacy (non-Open Access) publishing houses with
substantial market power. It raises entry barriers, lowers competition, and
increases costs for libraries and universities.

Abstract: Scientists increasingly recognize the importance of providing rich,
standards-adherent metadata to describe their experimental results. Despite the
availability of sophisticated tools to assist in the process of data
annotation, investigators generally seem to prefer to use spreadsheets when
supplying metadata, despite the limitations of spreadsheets in ensuring
metadata consistency and compliance with formal specifications. In this paper,
we describe an end-to-end approach that supports spreadsheet-based entry of
metadata, while ensuring rigorous adherence to community-based metadata
standards and providing quality control. Our methods employ several key
components, including customizable templates that capture metadata standards
and that can inform the spreadsheets that investigators use to author metadata,
controlled terminologies and ontologies for defining metadata values that can
be accessed directly from a spreadsheet, and an interactive Web-based tool that
allows users to rapidly identify and fix errors in their spreadsheet-based
metadata. We demonstrate how this approach is being deployed in a biomedical
consortium known as HuBMAP to define and collect metadata about a wide range of
biological assays.

Abstract: While scientists increasingly recognize the importance of metadata in
describing their data, spreadsheets remain the preferred tool for supplying
this information despite their limitations in ensuring compliance and quality.
Various tools have been developed to address these limitations, but they suffer

Motivation: 当前的文物记录实践（如使用电子表格或关系数据库）存在诸多问题，包括协作性差、难以表示推断关系的细节、数据结构扩展和整合困难以及数据重用性低。

Method: 提出了一种名为Synthesis的基于Web的协作系统，该系统利用CIDOC-CRM和RDF等现有标准，支持语义互操作性，旨在生成高质量、长久有效的数据。

Conclusion: 该系统有助于历史学家应对文物和相关证据的记录和研究中的挑战。

Abstract: A vast area of research in historical science concerns the documentation and
study of artefacts and related evidence. Current practice mostly uses
spreadsheets or simple relational databases to organise the information as rows
with multiple columns of related attributes. This form offers itself for data
analysis and scholarly interpretation, however it also poses problems including
i) the difficulty for collaborative but controlled documentation by a large
number of users, ii) the lack of representation of the details from which the
documented relations are inferred, iii) the difficulty to extend the underlying
data structures as well as to combine and integrate data from multiple and
diverse information sources, and iv) the limitation to reuse the data beyond
the context of a particular research activity. To support historians to cope
with these problems, in this paper we describe the Synthesis documentation
system and its use by a large number of historians in the context of an ongoing
research project in the field of History of Art. The system is Web-based and
collaborative, and makes use of existing standards for information
documentation and publication (CIDOC-CRM, RDF), focusing on semantic
interoperability and the production of data of high value and long-term
validity.

Conclusion: FAST CAT作为一个协作系统，旨在解决数字人文和类似实证研究中的数据录入和管理挑战，通过支持语义互操作性，提高了数据的可用性和可验证性。

Abstract: Descriptive and empirical sciences, such as History, are the sciences that
collect, observe and describe phenomena in order to explain them and draw
interpretative conclusions about influences, driving forces and impacts under
given circumstances. Spreadsheet software and relational database management
systems are still the dominant tools for quantitative analysis and overall data
management in these these sciences, allowing researchers to directly analyse
the gathered data and perform scholarly interpretation. However, this current
practice has a set of limitations, including the high dependency of the
collected data on the initial research hypothesis, usually useless for other
research, the lack of representation of the details from which the registered
relations are inferred, and the difficulty to revisit the original data sources
for verification, corrections or improvements. To cope with these problems, in
this paper we present FAST CAT, a collaborative system for assistive data entry
and curation in Digital Humanities and similar forms of empirical research. We
describe the related challenges, the overall methodology we follow for
supporting semantic interoperability, and discuss the use of FAST CAT in the
context of a European (ERC) project of Maritime History, called SeaLiT, which
examines economic, social and demographic impacts of the introduction of
steamboats in the Mediterranean area between the 1850s and the 1920s.

Motivation: 数字假想空间中的非结构化数据可以通过超图、超稀疏矩阵和关联数组代数的数学原理进行表示、遍历和转换。目前的GraphBLAS标准支持超图、超稀疏矩阵以及半链所需的数学运算。

Method: 提出了一种名为“半链”的新数学概念，它结合了成对的半环，为图分析、数据库操作和机器学习提供了基本运算。

Abstract: Social media, e-commerce, streaming video, e-mail, cloud documents, web
pages, traffic flows, and network packets fill vast digital lakes, rivers, and
oceans that we each navigate daily. This digital hyperspace is an amorphous
flow of data supported by continuous streams that stretch standard concepts of
type and dimension. The unstructured data of digital hyperspace can be
elegantly represented, traversed, and transformed via the mathematics of
hypergraphs, hypersparse matrices, and associative array algebra. This paper
explores a novel mathematical concept, the semilink, that combines pairs of
semirings to provide the essential operations for graph analytics, database
operations, and machine learning. The GraphBLAS standard currently supports
hypergraphs, hypersparse matrices, the mathematics required for semilinks, and
seamlessly performs graph, network, and matrix operations. With the addition of
key based indices (such as pointers to strings) and semilinks, GraphBLAS can
become a richer associative array algebra and be a plug-in replacement for
spreadsheets, database tables, and data centric operating systems, enhancing
the navigation of unstructured data found in digital hyperspace.

*Arthur Hoarau,Benjamin Quost,Sébastien Destercke,Willem Waegeman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过增加数据模态和样本量来解决多模态数据中的不确定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习方法假设epistemic uncertainty可以通过增加数据量来减少，而aleatoric uncertainty是不可避免的。然而，当信息来自不同模态时，这一假设受到挑战。本研究旨在探索一种新的方法来解决多模态数据中的不确定性分离问题。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的数据采集框架，该框架结合了主动学习、主动特征采集和不确定性量化。

Result: 通过在两个多模态数据集上进行概念验证，展示了所提出的数据采集框架。

Conclusion: 不确定性分离（epistemic uncertainty 和 aleatoric uncertainty）可以指导数据采集，通过增加样本量和数据模态来减少不确定性。

Abstract: To generate accurate and reliable predictions, modern AI systems need to
combine data from multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio,
spreadsheets, and time series. Multi-modal data introduces new opportunities
and challenges for disentangling uncertainty: it is commonly assumed in the
machine learning community that epistemic uncertainty can be reduced by
collecting more data, while aleatoric uncertainty is irreducible. However, this
assumption is challenged in modern AI systems when information is obtained from
different modalities. This paper introduces an innovative data acquisition
framework where uncertainty disentanglement leads to actionable decisions,
allowing sampling in two directions: sample size and data modality. The main
hypothesis is that aleatoric uncertainty decreases as the number of modalities
increases, while epistemic uncertainty decreases by collecting more
observations. We provide proof-of-concept implementations on two multi-modal
datasets to showcase our data acquisition framework, which combines ideas from
active learning, active feature acquisition and uncertainty quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在弥合基础模型在表格数据领域的应用与在语言和视觉领域相比存在的差距，为表格预测任务提供一个强大的语言模型解决方案。

Method: 提出了一种名为 TabuLa-8B 的语言模型，用于表格预测。该模型通过从 TabLib 语料库中提取大规模、高质量的训练数据，并采用新颖的打包和注意力机制进行微调，以适应表格数据的特性。

Result: TabuLa-8B 在 329 个数据集的测试套件上，零样本准确率比随机猜测高出 15 个百分点以上。在少样本设置下，其准确率比经过显式训练的 XGBoost 和 TabPFN 模型高 5-15 个百分点。

Conclusion: TabuLa-8B 在表格预测任务上展现出优越的性能，在零样本和少样本设置下均显著优于现有最先进的模型，如 XGBoost 和 TabPFN。

Abstract: Tabular data -- structured, heterogeneous, spreadsheet-style data with rows
and columns -- is widely used in practice across many domains. However, while
recent foundation models have reduced the need for developing task-specific
datasets and predictors in domains such as language modeling and computer
vision, this transfer learning paradigm has not had similar impact in the
tabular domain. In this work, we seek to narrow this gap and present TabuLa-8B,
a language model for tabular prediction. We define a process for extracting a
large, high-quality training dataset from the TabLib corpus, proposing methods
for tabular data filtering and quality control. Using the resulting dataset,
which comprises over 2.1B rows from over 4M unique tables, we fine-tune a Llama
3-8B large language model (LLM) for tabular data prediction (classification and
binned regression) using a novel packing and attention scheme for tabular
prediction. Through evaluation across a test suite of 329 datasets, we find
that TabuLa-8B has zero-shot accuracy on unseen tables that is over 15
percentage points (pp) higher than random guessing, a feat that is not possible
with existing state-of-the-art tabular prediction models (e.g. XGBoost,
TabPFN). In the few-shot setting (1-32 shots), without any fine-tuning on the
target datasets, TabuLa-8B is 5-15 pp more accurate than XGBoost and TabPFN
models that are explicitly trained on equal, or even up to 16x more data. We
release our model, code, and data along with the publication of this paper.

### [104] [Generating tabular datasets under differential privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14784)
*Gianluca Truda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sensitive tabular data (like financial/biomedical) needs private synthetic generation. Existing methods (GANs+DP) have privacy-quality trade-offs and training issues. This paper introduces TableDiffusion, a new differentially-private diffusion model for tabular data, which improves data quality, privacy efficiency, and avoids common problems, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models for sensitive tabular data, like GANs, suffer from memorization, undermining privacy. Differentially private methods create a quality-privacy trade-off, and GANs specifically face unstable training and mode collapse, which are worsened by privacy constraints and the nature of tabular data.

Method: This work optimizes the quality-privacy trade-off of generative models by implementing novel end-to-end models that leverage attention mechanisms for reversible tabular representations. It also introduces TableDiffusion, a differentially-private diffusion model for tabular data synthesis, which bypasses challenges in reconstructing mixed-type tabular data by predicting added noise.

Result: TableDiffusion produces higher-fidelity synthetic datasets, avoids mode collapse, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on privatised tabular data synthesis. The diffusion model is also shown to be vastly more data and privacy efficient than the adversarial paradigm.

Conclusion: The diffusion paradigm is more data and privacy efficient than the adversarial paradigm for synthetic tabular data generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is accelerating progress across fields and industries,
but relies on accessible and high-quality training data. Some of the most
important datasets are found in biomedical and financial domains in the form of
spreadsheets and relational databases. But this tabular data is often sensitive
in nature. Synthetic data generation offers the potential to unlock sensitive
data, but generative models tend to memorise and regurgitate training data,
which undermines the privacy goal. To remedy this, researchers have
incorporated the mathematical framework of Differential Privacy (DP) into the
training process of deep neural networks. But this creates a trade-off between
the quality and privacy of the resulting data. Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) are the dominant paradigm for synthesising tabular data under DP, but
suffer from unstable adversarial training and mode collapse, which are
exacerbated by the privacy constraints and challenging tabular data modality.
This work optimises the quality-privacy trade-off of generative models,
producing higher quality tabular datasets with the same privacy guarantees. We
implement novel end-to-end models that leverage attention mechanisms to learn
reversible tabular representations. We also introduce TableDiffusion, the first
differentially-private diffusion model for tabular data synthesis. Our
experiments show that TableDiffusion produces higher-fidelity synthetic
datasets, avoids the mode collapse problem, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on privatised tabular data synthesis. By implementing
TableDiffusion to predict the added noise, we enabled it to bypass the
challenges of reconstructing mixed-type tabular data. Overall, the diffusion
paradigm proves vastly more data and privacy efficient than the adversarial
paradigm, due to augmented re-use of each data batch and a smoother iterative
training process.

TL;DR: This study uses time series prediction to forecast MRT3 daily ridership, addressing challenges faced by commuters and the DOTr due to fluctuating passenger numbers and outdated data management methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The daily ridership of MRT3 fluctuates due to various factors, making it challenging for commuters to plan their itineraries and for the DOTr to analyze historical data, which is currently managed using spreadsheets.

Method: Time series prediction

Result: The study aims to provide a more efficient way to forecast daily traffic and anticipate future attendance at MRT3 stations.

Conclusion: This study presents a time series prediction of daily traffic to anticipate future attendance at a particular station on specific days.

Abstract: Since its establishment in 1999, the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT3) has
served as a transportation option for numerous passengers in Metro Manila,
Philippines. The Philippine government's transportation department records more
than a thousand people using the MRT3 daily and forecasting the daily passenger
count may be rather challenging. The MRT3's daily ridership fluctuates owing to
variables such as holidays, working days, and other unexpected issues.
Commuters do not know how many other commuters are on their route on a given
day, which may hinder their ability to plan an efficient itinerary. Currently,
the DOTr depends on spreadsheets containing historical data, which might be
challenging to examine. This study presents a time series prediction of daily
traffic to anticipate future attendance at a particular station on specific
days.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文件类型的正确识别在取证调查中至关重要，但攻击者可能试图通过混淆文件扩展名或文件头来隐藏文件类型。

Method: 提出了一种基于半监督生成对抗网络（SGAN）的文件类型识别方法，通过对抗性训练来克服文件扩展名或文件头被混淆的问题。

Result: 在11种不同文件类型的分类任务中，SGAN模型达到了97.6%的准确率，并且在监督样本较少的情况下比传统神经网络和其他机器学习算法更精确。

Conclusion: 我们提出的基于SGAN的文件分类器在文件类型识别方面展现了高精度，尤其是在监督样本有限的情况下，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Correctly identifying the type of file under examination is a critical part
of a forensic investigation. The file type alone suggests the embedded content,
such as a picture, video, manuscript, spreadsheet, etc. In cases where a system
owner might desire to keep their files inaccessible or file type concealed, we
propose using an adversarially-trained machine learning neural network to
determine a file's true type even if the extension or file header is obfuscated
to complicate its discovery. Our semi-supervised generative adversarial network
(SGAN) achieved 97.6% accuracy in classifying files across 11 different types.
We also compared our network against a traditional standalone neural network
and three other machine learning algorithms. The adversarially-trained network
proved to be the most precise file classifier especially in scenarios with few
supervised samples available. Our implementation of a file classifier using an
SGAN is implemented on GitHub (https://ksaintg.github.io/SGAN-File-Classier).

Motivation: 为了自动理解表格数据中固有的语义结构，弥补现有研究仅关注空间信息而忽略关系信息（如层级和并列关系）的不足。

Method: 提出了一种名为TabularNet的新型神经网络架构，该架构包括一个空间编码器（利用行/列池化和双向门控循环单元）和一个基于图卷积网络（GCN）的编码器（基于WordNet树构建图），以同时提取空间和关系信息。

Result: TabularNet在三个分类任务和两个真实世界电子表格数据集上证明了其有效性，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，我们提出的TabularNet在三个分类任务和两个真实世界电子表格数据集上优于最先进的基线。

Abstract: Tabular data are ubiquitous for the widespread applications of tables and
hence have attracted the attention of researchers to extract underlying
information. One of the critical problems in mining tabular data is how to
understand their inherent semantic structures automatically. Existing studies
typically adopt Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to model the spatial
information of tabular structures yet ignore more diverse relational
information between cells, such as the hierarchical and paratactic
relationships. To simultaneously extract spatial and relational information
from tables, we propose a novel neural network architecture, TabularNet. The
spatial encoder of TabularNet utilizes the row/column-level Pooling and the
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) to capture statistical information
and local positional correlation, respectively. For relational information, we
design a new graph construction method based on the WordNet tree and adopt a
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based encoder that focuses on the
hierarchical and paratactic relationships between cells. Our neural network
architecture can be a unified neural backbone for different understanding tasks
and utilized in a multitask scenario. We conduct extensive experiments on three
classification tasks with two real-world spreadsheet data sets, and the results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TabularNet over state-of-the-art
baselines.

Abstract: We show how a declarative functional programming specification of
backpropagation yields a visual and transparent implementation within

implementation exploits array worksheet formulas, manual calculation, and has a
sequential order of computation similar to the processing of a systolic array.
The implementation uses no hidden macros nor user-defined functions; there are
no loops, assignment statements, or links to any procedural programs written in
conventional languages. As an illustration, we compare a Visual Backpropagation
solution to a Tensorflow (Python) solution on a standard regression problem.

Motivation: 为了应对学习算法（任何类型）的实证检验相对稀少的问题，我们引入了一个新的公共领域、模块化、最优学习测试环境 (MOLTE)。

Method: MOLTE 是一个基于 Matlab 的模拟器，用于贝叶斯排序和选择问题、随机老虎机或顺序实验设计问题。它允许在各种问题（每个问题都在其自己的 .m 模块中表示）的上下文中比较多种学习策略（表示为一系列 .m 模块）。

Conclusion: MOLTE 提供了一个易于使用的工具，供研究社区使用，以便对算法和测试问题进行更全面的测试。

Abstract: We address the relative paucity of empirical testing of learning algorithms
(of any type) by introducing a new public-domain, Modular, Optimal Learning
Testing Environment (MOLTE) for Bayesian ranking and selection problem,
stochastic bandits or sequential experimental design problems. The Matlab-based
simulator allows the comparison of a number of learning policies (represented
as a series of .m modules) in the context of a wide range of problems (each
represented in its own .m module) which makes it easy to add new algorithms and
new test problems. State-of-the-art policies and various problem classes are
provided in the package. The choice of problems and policies is guided through
a spreadsheet-based interface. Different graphical metrics are included. MOLTE
is designed to be compatible with parallel computing to scale up from local
desktop to clusters and clouds. We offer MOLTE as an easy-to-use tool for the
research community that will make it possible to perform much more
comprehensive testing, spanning a broader selection of algorithms and test
problems. We demonstrate the capabilities of MOLTE through a series of
comparisons of policies on a starter library of test problems. We also address
the problem of tuning and constructing priors that have been largely overlooked
in optimal learning literature. We envision MOLTE as a modest spur to provide
researchers an easy environment to study interesting questions involved in
optimal learning.

tools to the current state of Excel, which can be described as an Integrated
Development Environment (IDE) for analytics. The slow evolution of Excel from
an automation tool for ledgers to an IDE for analytics explains why many people
have not noticed that Excel includes a fully functional database, an OLAP
Engine, multiple statistical programming languages, multiple third-party
software libraries, dynamic charts, and real time data connectors. The
simplicity of accessing these multiple tools is a low-code framework controlled
from the Excel tool that is effectively an IDE. Once we acknowledge Excel's
shift from a desk top application to an IDE for analytics, the importance of
establishing a comprehensive risk framework for managing this distinctive
development environment becomes clear. In this paper we will explain how the
current risk framework for spreadsheets needs to be expanded to manage the
growing risks of using Excel as an IDE for analytics.

TL;DR: 为解决教学中评估Excel作业的挑战，开发了一个智能辅导系统（ITS），可自动分析学生提交的文件并提供分级反馈，提高了作业正确率并获得学生好评。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于电子表格是终端用户广泛使用的工具，并且已纳入许多课程中，但目前在教学环境中评估电子表格作业的数字解决方案仍然很少。因此，需要开发一个系统来自动评估学生的Excel提交并提供反馈。

Method: 开发了一个智能辅导系统（ITS），可以自动分析学生的Excel提交文件，包括值匹配、公式详细分析和解决方案质量评估。为考虑学生的学习水平，开发了不同反馈级别的ITS，逐步提供更多关于错误的信息。

Result: 研究表明，更高级别的反馈能够提高正确提交的百分比，并且学生认为这种反馈易于理解且有帮助。

Conclusion: 本研究开发了一个智能辅导系统（ITS），可以自动评估学生的Excel作业并提供个性化反馈，提高了作业的正确率，并被学生认为是可理解和有帮助的。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are one of the most widely used tools for end users. As a
result, spreadsheets such as Excel are now included in many curricula. However,
digital solutions for assessing spreadsheet assignments are still scarce in the
teaching context. Therefore, we have developed an Intelligent Tutoring System
(ITS) to review students' Excel submissions and provide individualized feedback
automatically. Although the lecturer only needs to provide one reference
solution, the students' submissions are analyzed automatically in several ways:
value matching, detailed analysis of the formulas, and quality assessment of
the solution. To take the students' learning level into account, we have
developed feedback levels for an ITS that provide gradually more information
about the error by using one of the different analyses. Feedback at a higher
level has been shown to lead to a higher percentage of correct submissions and
was also perceived as well understandable and helpful by the students.

TL;DR: 计算思维应成为第四项基本技能。本研究提出了一种基于 Beaufort 尺度的创新方法，通过将传统纸质问题和数据检索过程数字化，以整合学科并构建数字图式。实验发现该方法能同时提升学生的学科知识和数字技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算思维应该成为继阅读、写作和算术（3R）之后的第四项基本技能。为了达到计算思维技能，特别是数字问题解决方法拥有自己图式（schemata）的水平，还有很长的路要走。

Method: 将传统、基于纸张的问题和数据检索过程的转换在一个八年级行动研究研究的框架内进行介绍。

Result: 研究发现，与传统的教科书和去背景化的数字环境相比，学生的内​​容知识和数字技能都得到了更有效的培养。

Conclusion: 该方法可以应用于任何基于纸张的问题，这些问题的解决方案在数字环境中更有效，并且为构建主题和信息学的主题提供了各种形式。

Abstract: Computational thinking should be the fourth fundamental skill, along with
reading, writing, and arithmetic (3R). To reach the level where computational
thinking skills, especially digital problem solving have their own schemata,
there is a long way to go. In the present paper, a novel approach is detailed
to support subject integration and building digital schemata, on the well-known
Beaufort scale. The conversion of a traditional, paper-based problem and a data
retrieval process are presented within the frame of a Grade 8 action research
study. It is found that both students content knowledge and their digital
skills developed more efficiently than in traditional course book and
decontextualized digital environments. Furthermore, the method presented here
can be adapted to any paper-based problems whose solutions would be more
effective in a digital environment and which offer various forms for building
schemata both in the subject matter and informatics.

TL;DR: SAM是一种新的方法，用于表征紧急庇护所的访问模式，以衡量客户的脆弱性。SAM易于使用，所需数据少，并且可以实时显示外部因素的影响。


<details>

Motivation: 为庇护所运营商提供一种直观的、可由非技术人员通过电子表格操作实现的访问模式理解方式，以衡量客户的脆弱性。

Method: 使用简化接入指标（SAM）对庇护所客户数据进行分析，以表征紧急庇护所的访问模式。

Result: SAM生成的结果与传统的客户聚类分析相似，但所需数据更少，能够实时显示外部因素对访问模式的影响，并能直接作为脆弱性指标。

Conclusion: SAM是一种新的方法，用于表征紧急庇护所的访问模式，作为衡量庇护所客户脆弱性的指标。SAM旨在为庇护所运营商提供一种直观的访问模式理解方式，该方式可由非技术人员通过电子表格操作来实现。SAM生成的结果与传统的过渡性、偶发性和慢性客户聚类分析相似，但所需数据更少，因此能够实时显示外部因素如何影响庇护所的访问模式。SAM还可以让庇护所工作人员超越传统的客户分类标签，直接使用SAM的“软”输出作为脆弱性指标。

Abstract: The Simplified Access Metric (SAM) is a new approach for characterizing
emergency shelter access patterns as a measure of shelter client vulnerability.
The goal of SAM is to provide shelter operators with an intuitive way to
understand access patterns that can be implemented by non-technical staff using
spreadsheet operations. Client data from a large North American shelter will be
used to demonstrate that SAM produces similar results to traditional
transitional, episodic and chronic client cluster analysis. Since SAM requires
less data than cluster analysis, it is also able to generate a real time
picture of how shelter access patterns are affected by external factors.
Timelines generated from nine years of shelter client data using SAM
demonstrate the impact of Housing First programming and the COVID-19 lockdown
on how people access shelter. Finally, SAM allows shelter staff to move beyond
assigning transitional, episodic and chronic labels and instead use the "soft"
output of SAM directly as a measure of vulnerability.

Motivation: 解决PL和CA领域在疫情期间社区内缺乏长期联系和指导的问题，即只有在社区内已有联系的人才能建立新的长期联系。

Method: 文章介绍了PL（编程语言）和CA（计算机体系结构）两个学术领域在疫情期间为解决社区内缺乏长期联系和指导的问题而创建的指导计划。PL领域创建了SIGPLAN-M，CA领域创建了CALM。SIGPLAN-M已经覆盖了328名受指导者和234名指导者，遍布41个国家，并被评价为“改变人生”和“职业救星”。CALM目前处于试点阶段，有13名指导者和21名受指导者，遍布7个国家，反馈积极。文章分享了这两个计划的设计、影响和挑战。

Result: SIGPLAN-M已覆盖328名受指导者和234名指导者，遍布41个国家，受指导者评价积极。CALM处于试点阶段，已有13名指导者和21名受指导者，遍布7个国家，反馈积极。

Conclusion: 希望这项工作能推动计算机科学领域更广泛的长期指导计划。

Abstract: Early in the pandemic, we -- leaders in the research areas of programming
languages (PL) and computer architecture (CA) -- realized that we had a
problem: the only way to form new lasting connections in the community was to
already have lasting connections in the community. Both of our academic
communities had wonderful short-term mentoring programs to address this
problem, but it was clear that we needed long-term mentoring programs.
  Those of us in CA approached this scientifically, making an evidence-backed
case for community-wide long-term mentoring. In the meantime, one of us in PL
had impulsively launched an unofficial long-term mentoring program, founded on
chaos and spreadsheets. In January 2021, the latter grew to an official
cross-institutional long-term mentoring program called SIGPLAN-M; in January
2022, the former grew to Computer Architecture Long-term Mentoring (CALM).
  The impacts have been strong: SIGPLAN-M reaches 328 mentees and 234 mentors
across 41 countries, and mentees have described it as "life changing" and "a
career saver." And while CALM is in its pilot phase -- with 13 mentors and 21
mentees across 7 countries -- it has received very positive feedback. The
leaders of SIGPLAN-M and CALM shared our designs, impacts, and challenges along
the way. Now, we wish to share those with you. We hope this will kick-start a
larger long-term mentoring effort across all of computer science.

Motivation: 为了应对多伦多市老年护理机构在安排护理人员方面日益增长的挑战，并降低兼职护士的高缺勤率。

Method: 开发了一个基于电子表格的排班工具，其核心是一个分层优化模型，该模型在满足约束条件（如资历要求）的前提下，最大化总偏好得分并尽可能满足需求。

Result: 该工具在一家391张床位的护理院实施后，将生成可行排班表的时间从数小时缩短到不到一小时，并且平均有94%的排班获得了护士的首选。

Conclusion: 该排班工具能够自动化生成满足复杂优先顺序要求的可行排班表，同时最大化满足护士的偏好。

Abstract: The City of Toronto Long Term Care Homes & Services (LTCH&S) division is one
of the largest providers of long-term care in the Canadian province of Ontario,
providing care to 2,640 residents at 10 homes across Toronto. Our collaboration
with LTCH&S was initiated to facilitate the increasingly challenging task of
scheduling nursing staff and reduce high absenteeism rate observed among the
part-time nurses. We developed a spreadsheet-based scheduling tool to automate
the generation of schedules and incorporate nurses' preferences for different
shifts into the schedules. At the core of the scheduling tool is a hierarchical
optimization model that generates a feasible schedule with the highest total
preference score while satisfying the maximum possible demand. Feasible
schedules had to abide by a set of complex seniority requirements which
prioritized more senior nurses when allocating the available shifts. Our
scheduling tool was implemented in a 391-bed home in Toronto. The tool allowed
nursing managers to generate feasible schedules within a fraction of an hour,
in contrast to the status-quo manual approach which could took up to tens of
hours. In addition, the schedules successfully accounted for preferences with
on average above 94% of the allocated shifts ranked as most preferred.

Conclusion: 该研究结果表明，该组织需要制定明确的电子表格模型开发原则和指南，以确保数据完整性、减少工作重复并优化电子表格的使用以实现机构目标。

Abstract: This paper presents the findings of a case study of spreadsheet use in a
higher education institution in the UK. The paper considers the use of
spreadsheets in two units of the organisation, academic registry and finance.
Spreadsheet use is explored in terms of importance, training, experience,
purpose, techniques deployed, size of spreadsheets created and sharing of
spreadsheets. The implications of the results are then considered in terms of
accurate reporting to external funding bodies such the funding councils,
internal data integrity and internal data efficiencies. The results show a
large volume of spreadsheets being created and used, that the profile of
spreadsheet developers is typical of other studies of spreadsheet use and the
need for the organisation to have clear principles and guidelines for the
development of spreadsheet models in the organisation to ensure data integrity,
reduce duplication of effort and to optimise the use of spreadsheets to meet
the institutions goals.

Abstract: The article substantiates the necessity to develop training methods of
computer simulation of neural networks in the spreadsheet environment. The
systematic review of their application to simulating artificial neural networks
is performed. The authors distinguish basic approaches to solving the problem
of network computer simulation training in the spreadsheet environment, joint
application of spreadsheets and tools of neural network simulation, application
of third-party add-ins to spreadsheets, development of macros using the
embedded languages of spreadsheets; use of standard spreadsheet add-ins for
non-linear optimization, creation of neural networks in the spreadsheet
environment without add-ins and macros. After analyzing a collection of
writings of 1890-1950, the research determines the role of the scientific
journal "Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics", its founder Nicolas Rashevsky
and the scientific community around the journal in creating and developing
models and methods of computational neuroscience. There are identified
psychophysical basics of creating neural networks, mathematical foundations of
neural computing and methods of neuroengineering (image recognition, in
particular). The role of Walter Pitts in combining the descriptive and
quantitative theories of training is discussed. It is shown that to acquire
neural simulation competences in the spreadsheet environment, one should master
the models based on the historical and genetic approach. It is indicated that
there are three groups of models, which are promising in terms of developing
corresponding methods - the continuous two-factor model of Rashevsky, the
discrete model of McCulloch and Pitts, and the discrete-continuous models of
Householder and Landahl.

mathability computer-supported real world problem solving. This approach is
based on - from the very beginning of training - a two-directional knowledge
transfer, data and error analysis and handling, and the programming aspect of
spreadsheets. Based on these features, E2SCF is set up for basic and general
users to build up firm spreadsheet knowledge and to develop transferable

Conclusion: The paper identifies key research directions for spreadsheet evolution and use, considering trends like Big Data, end-user computing, and mobile computing, and discusses the implications for end-users.

Abstract: The humble spreadsheet is the most widely used data storage, manipulation and
modelling tool. Its ubiquity over the past 30 years has seen its successful
application in every area of life. Surprisingly the spreadsheet has remained
fundamentally unchanged over the past three decades. As spreadsheet technology
enters its 4th decade a number of drivers of change are beginning to impact
upon the spreadsheet. The rise of Big Data, increased end-user computing and
mobile computing will undoubtedly increasingly shape the evolution and use of
spreadsheet technology.
  To explore the future of spreadsheet technology a workshop was convened with
the aim of "bringing together academia and industry to examine the future
direction of spreadsheet technology and the consequences for users". This paper
records the views of the participants on the reasons for the success of the
spreadsheet, the trends driving change and the likely directions of change for
the spreadsheet. We then set out key directions for further research in the
evolution and use of spreadsheets. Finally we look at the implications of these
trends for the end users who after all are the reason for the remarkable
success of the spreadsheet.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SAGE 通过其新颖的数据语义模型和高效的算法，能够自动推荐多样化且有用的数据透视表，解决了现有方法的不足，并在实验和案例研究中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在处理高维数据集时，尤其是在电子表格中，识别能够提供有用摘要的属性组合以创建数据透视表是一个挑战。现有方法在数据透视表的多样化方面存在不足，导致推荐结果冗余。因此，需要一种新的方法来自动推荐有见地且可解释的数据透视表。

Method: SAGE 是一个数据语义感知系统，用于推荐 k 个有预算限制的多样化数据透视表。它通过一个数据语义感知模型来衡量单个数据透视表的效用和一组数据透视表的多样性，并使用可扩展的贪婪算法来选择一组具有高效用的多样化数据透视表，该算法利用数据语义来显著减少组合搜索空间。

Result: SAGE 在三个真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，其性能优于替代方法，并且能够有效地处理高维数据集。此外，SAGE 在定性上也优于商业软件和大型语言模型。

Conclusion: SAGE 系统通过其数据语义感知模型和可扩展的贪婪算法，在推荐 k 个多样化且有用的数据透视表方面优于现有方法，并在真实数据集上进行了有效扩展。通过案例研究，SAGE 在定性方面也优于商业软件和大型语言模型。

Abstract: Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets. In
a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data
by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However,
identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables
remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the
problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot
tables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of
recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works
inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to
consider the problem of pivot table diversification.
  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted
diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k
recommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is
insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences,
while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each
other, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical
contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a
single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a
scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot
tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce
the combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world
datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently
scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we present
several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over
commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users in industrial settings often struggle to access and combine data from heterogeneous sources (spreadsheets, databases, APIs) to answer questions. Existing Text-to-SQL applications using LLMs are impractical due to their inability to cope with this heterogeneity.

Method: Introducing the siwarex platform to enable natural language access to databases and APIs, and extending the Spider dataset by replacing tables with data retrieval APIs.

Result: The siwarex platform performs well in coping with data source heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The siwarex platform effectively handles data source heterogeneity, demonstrated by its performance on a modified Spider benchmark.

Abstract: In many industrial settings, users wish to ask questions whose answers may be
found in structured data sources such as a spreadsheets, databases, APIs, or
combinations thereof. Often, the user doesn't know how to identify or access
the right data source. This problem is compounded even further if multiple (and
potentially siloed) data sources must be assembled to derive the answer.
Recently, various Text-to-SQL applications that leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) have addressed some of these problems by enabling users to ask questions
in natural language. However, these applications remain impractical in
realistic industrial settings because they fail to cope with the data source
heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this paper, we address
heterogeneity by introducing the siwarex platform, which enables seamless
natural language access to both databases and APIs. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of siwarex, we extend the popular Spider dataset and benchmark by
replacing some of its tables by data retrieval APIs. We find that siwarex does
a good job of coping with data source heterogeneity. Our modified Spider
benchmark will soon be available to the research community

Motivation: 本文提出了一个开源的策展工具包，旨在生成结构良好且可互操作的数据。

Method: 该研究将策展分为离散的组件，并采用面向模式的方法来审计重构，将复杂且分散的表格数据重构为符合目标模式。任务分离允许在没有源数据的情况下开发软件和分析。

Result: 该工具包被实现为一个 Python 包和一个‘无代码’的可视化 Web 应用程序，并提供了一个跨本地委员会的数据集示例，其中将分散的源数据集成到一个数据库中。

Conclusion: 该工具包旨在通过模式到模式的映射来转换数据，并提供了一个可以跨所有交叉的模式定义，以实现数据的结构化。

Abstract: This paper presents an open-source curatorial toolkit intended to produce
well-structured and interoperable data. Curation is divided into discrete
components, with a schema-centric focus for auditable restructuring of complex
and scattered tabular data to conform to a destination schema. Task separation
allows development of software and analysis without source data being present.
Transformations are captured as high-level sequential scripts describing
schema-to-schema mappings, reducing complexity and resource requirements.
Ultimately, data are transformed, but the objective is that any data meeting a
schema definition can be restructured using a crosswalk. The toolkit is
available both as a Python package, and as a 'no-code' visual web application.
A visual example is presented, derived from a longitudinal study where
scattered source data from hundreds of local councils are integrated into a
single database.

Conclusion: 该研究通过利用相似组织中已存在的公式，并结合对比学习技术，成功开发了一个名为 Auto-Formula 的系统，能够准确预测用户在目标单元格中所需的公式。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are widely recognized as the most popular end-user programming
tools, which blend the power of formula-based computation, with an intuitive
table-based interface. Today, spreadsheets are used by billions of users to
manipulate tables, most of whom are neither database experts nor professional
programmers.
  Despite the success of spreadsheets, authoring complex formulas remains
challenging, as non-technical users need to look up and understand non-trivial
formula syntax. To address this pain point, we leverage the observation that
there is often an abundance of similar-looking spreadsheets in the same
organization, which not only have similar data, but also share similar
computation logic encoded as formulas. We develop an Auto-Formula system that
can accurately predict formulas that users want to author in a target
spreadsheet cell, by learning and adapting formulas that already exist in
similar spreadsheets, using contrastive-learning techniques inspired by
"similar-face recognition" from compute vision.
  Extensive evaluations on over 2K test formulas extracted from real enterprise
spreadsheets show the effectiveness of Auto-Formula over alternatives. Our
benchmark data is available at https://github.com/microsoft/Auto-Formula to
facilitate future research.

*Luigi Asprino,Enrico Daga,Justin Dowdy,Paul Mulholland,Aldo Gangemi,Marco Ratta*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SPARQL Anything is a system that lets you query diverse data formats (like CSV, JSON, even Word docs) using SPARQL, making data integration easier for knowledge engineers. It supports various features and has been evaluated by users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To propose a data integration framework for knowledge engineers, specifically the SPARQL Anything system, which allows querying heterogeneous resources as if they were in RDF using SPARQL 1.1.

Method: The paper analyzes the design rationale and software architecture of the SPARQL Anything system. It also references real-world scenarios and reports on user value through a community survey and an industry field report.

Result: SPARQL Anything supports a wide variety of file formats (CSV, JSON, XML, Spreadsheets, Markdown, YAML, DOCx, Bibtex), querying Web APIs flexibly, parameterized queries, and complex pipelines. User value was assessed through a community survey and industry field report.

Conclusion: The paper describes the design rationale and software architecture of the SPARQL Anything system, highlighting its ability to query heterogeneous resources as if they were in RDF using SPARQL 1.1. It supports a wide range of file formats and features like querying Web APIs and complex pipelines. The paper also includes real-world scenarios and user feedback from a community survey and industry field report.

Abstract: What should a data integration framework for knowledge engineers look like?
Recent research on Knowledge Graph construction proposes the design of a
fa\c{c}ade, a notion borrowed from object-oriented software engineering. This
idea is applied to SPARQL Anything, a system that allows querying heterogeneous
resources as-if they were in RDF, in plain SPARQL 1.1, by overloading the
SERVICE clause. SPARQL Anything supports a wide variety of file formats, from
popular ones (CSV, JSON, XML, Spreadsheets) to others that are not supported by
alternative solutions (Markdown, YAML, DOCx, Bibtex). Features include querying
Web APIs with high flexibility, parametrised queries, and chaining multiple
transformations into complex pipelines. In this paper, we describe the design
rationale and software architecture of the SPARQL Anything system. We provide
references to an extensive set of reusable, real-world scenarios from various
application domains. We report on the value-to-users of the founding
assumptions of its design, compared to alternative solutions through a
community survey and a field report from the industry.

*Mukul Singh,José Cambronero,Sumit Gulwani,Vu Le,Carina Negreanu,Gust Verbruggen*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: DataVinci 是一个无监督的字符串数据清理系统，通过学习正则表达式模式和利用 LLM 来处理复杂的字符串，从而检测和修复语法和语义错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 字符串数据在真实数据集很常见，但现有的字符串数据清理方法通常仅限于错误检测，或者需要用户提供注释、示例或约束来修复错误。此外，现有系统独立地关注字符串中的语法错误或语义错误，而忽略了字符串通常包含语法和语义子字符串的组合。

Method: DataVinci 是一个完全无监督的字符串数据错误检测和修复系统。它学习基于正则表达式的模式，覆盖列中的大部分值，并将不满足这些模式的值报告为数据错误。DataVinci 可以根据在其他列上学习到的主要模式和约束自动推导出数据错误的编辑，无需用户进一步交互。为了处理同时包含语法和语义子字符串的字符串，DataVinci 使用 LLM 在学习主要模式和推导编辑之前抽象（和重新具体化）字符串的部分。由于并非所有数据都能产生主要模式，DataVinci 利用现有程序（读取目标数据）的执行信息来识别和纠正否则无法识别的数据修复。

Result: DataVinci 学习基于正则表达式的模式来识别和修复字符串数据中的错误，能够处理同时包含语法和语义子字符串的字符串，并利用程序执行信息来改进修复。在评估中，DataVinci 在错误检测和修复任务上均优于 7 个基线。

Conclusion: DataVinci 在错误检测和修复方面优于 7 个基线，并在 4 个现有和新的基准测试中进行了评估。

Abstract: String data is common in real-world datasets: 67.6% of values in a sample of
1.8 million real Excel spreadsheets from the web were represented as text.
Systems that successfully clean such string data can have a significant impact
on real users. While prior work has explored errors in string data, proposed
approaches have often been limited to error detection or require that the user
provide annotations, examples, or constraints to fix the errors. Furthermore,
these systems have focused independently on syntactic errors or semantic errors
in strings, but ignore that strings often contain both syntactic and semantic
substrings. We introduce DataVinci, a fully unsupervised string data error
detection and repair system. DataVinci learns regular-expression-based patterns
that cover a majority of values in a column and reports values that do not
satisfy such patterns as data errors. DataVinci can automatically derive edits
to the data error based on the majority patterns and constraints learned over
other columns without the need for further user interaction. To handle strings
with both syntactic and semantic substrings, DataVinci uses an LLM to abstract
(and re-concretize) portions of strings that are semantic prior to learning
majority patterns and deriving edits. Because not all data can result in
majority patterns, DataVinci leverages execution information from an existing
program (which reads the target data) to identify and correct data repairs that
would not otherwise be identified. DataVinci outperforms 7 baselines on both
error detection and repair when evaluated on 4 existing and new benchmarks.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Auto-Tables系统通过自动合成转换流程，解决了现实世界中表格数据不规范的问题，提高了数据准备效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在处理现实世界中的电子表格和网页表格时，超过30%的表格不符合关系型标准，需要复杂的表格重组转换才能方便地使用SQL等工具进行查询。手动编程转换困难，给技术和非技术用户带来了困扰。

Method: 开发了一个名为Auto-Tables的系统，该系统可以自动合成包含多步骤转换（用Python或其他语言）的流程，将非关系型表格转换为标准的 and relational forms，用于下游分析。

Result: Auto-Tables系统可以为70%以上的测试用例成功合成转换，并且速度快，无需用户输入。

Conclusion: Auto-Tables系统能够自动合成转换流程，处理超过70%的非关系型表格，并且速度快，无需用户干预，能够有效帮助技术和非技术用户准备数据用于分析。

Abstract: Relational tables, where each row corresponds to an entity and each column
corresponds to an attribute, have been the standard for tables in relational
databases. However, such a standard cannot be taken for granted when dealing
with tables "in the wild". Our survey of real spreadsheet-tables and web-tables
shows that over 30% of such tables do not conform to the relational standard,
for which complex table-restructuring transformations are needed before these
tables can be queried easily using SQL-based analytics tools. Unfortunately,
the required transformations are non-trivial to program, which has become a
substantial pain point for technical and non-technical users alike, as
evidenced by large numbers of forum questions in places like StackOverflow and
Excel/Power-BI/Tableau forums.
  We develop an Auto-Tables system that can automatically synthesize pipelines
with multi-step transformations (in Python or other languages), to transform
non-relational tables into standard relational forms for downstream analytics,
obviating the need for users to manually program transformations. We compile an
extensive benchmark for this new task, by collecting 244 real test cases from
user spreadsheets and online forums. Our evaluation suggests that Auto-Tables
can successfully synthesize transformations for over 70% of test cases at
interactive speeds, without requiring any input from users, making this an
effective tool for both technical and non-technical users to prepare data for
analytics.

TL;DR: TACO通过利用表局部性来压缩电子表格的公式图，从而加速查询和维护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格是流行的数据分析工具，其中公式图的查询和维护效率对用户交互至关重要。然而，公式图通常庞大而复杂，导致查询和维护耗时，降低了交互性。

Method: TACO框架利用了电子表格的“表局部性”属性，即相邻单元格的公式结构相似。它识别并利用了四种基于表局部性的模式来压缩公式图，实现了在不解压的情况下直接查询压缩后的图，并能增量维护图结构。

Result: TACO框架能够显著减小公式图的大小，并在查询公式图时提供显著的速度提升，相比基线和商业系统分别有高达34,972倍和632倍的加速。

Conclusion: TACO框架能够显著减小公式图的大小，并在查询公式图时提供显著的速度提升，相比基线和商业系统分别有高达34,972倍和632倍的加速。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are one of the most popular data analysis tools, wherein users
can express computation as formulae alongside data. The ensuing dependencies
are tracked as formula graphs. Efficiently querying and maintaining these
formula graphs is critical for interactivity across multiple settings.
Unfortunately, formula graphs are often large and complex such that querying
and maintaining them is time-consuming, reducing interactivity. We propose
TACO, a framework for efficiently compressing formula graphs, thereby reducing
the time for querying and maintenance. The efficiency of TACO stems from a key
spreadsheet property: tabular locality, which means that cells close to each
other are likely to have similar formula structures. We leverage four such
tabular locality-based patterns and develop algorithms for compressing formula
graphs using these patterns, directly querying the compressed graph without
decompression, and incrementally maintaining the graph during updates. We
integrate TACO into an open-source spreadsheet system and show that TACO can
significantly reduce formula graph sizes. For querying formula graphs, the
speedups of TACO over a baseline implemented in our framework and a commercial
spreadsheet system are up to 34,972x and 632x, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找一种合并工程模型的方法，该方法不需要模型作者之间达成共识（同意），而我们的方法通过使用保持语义的理论和模型态射来实现这一目标。

Method: 通过将电子表格公式表达为代数理论，将值表达为模型，并将重叠表达为理论和模型态射，然后执行范畴论中的余极限、提升和Kan扩展构造，来合并多个电子表格或在电子表格之间交换数据。

Result: 我们描述了在一家主要能源公司的一个实际油气计算案例研究，其中整合了两个由两名不相关的工程师创建的不同套管压力测试（MASP）计算电子表格，并描述了由此产生的理论和模型。

Conclusion: 将方法论应用于企业规模的工程工作，并讨论了与验证语义保持和集成表一致性相关的自动化定理证明负担。

Abstract: We describe a method for merging multiple spreadsheets into one sheet, and/or
exchanging data among the sheets, by expressing each sheet's formulae as an
algebraic (equational) theory and each sheet's values as a model of its theory,
expressing the overlap between the sheets as theory and model morphisms, and
then performing colimit, lifting, and Kan-extension constructions from category
theory to compute a canonically universal integrated theory and model, which
can then be expressed as a spreadsheet. Our motivation is to find methods of
merging engineering models that do not require consensus (agreement) among the
authors of the models being merged, a condition fulfilled by our method because
theory and model morphisms are semantics-preserving. We describe a case study
of this methodology on a real-world oil and gas calculation at a major energy
company, describing the theories and models that arise when integrating two
different casing pressure test (MASP) calculation spreadsheets constructed by
two non-interacting engineers. We also describe the automated theorem proving
burden associated with both verifying the semantics preservation of the overlap
mappings as well as verifying the conservativity/consistency of the resulting
integrated sheet. We conclude with thoughts on how to apply the methodology to
scale engineering efforts across the enterprise.

Motivation: 用户经常需要将电子表格加载到数据科学环境中以执行高级分析，但现有方法存在运行时或内存使用高的问题，这在商品系统上阻碍了数据探索。

Method: 通过将解压和解析紧密结合来最小化内存使用，并引入优化的特定于电子表格的解析例程和并行处理来减少运行时。

Result: 该方法比现有方法快3倍，内存占用少40倍。

Conclusion: 用户可以将电子表格加载到R环境中，并且该方法比现有方法更快，内存占用更少。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are widely used for data exploration. Since spreadsheet systems
have limited capabilities, users often need to load spreadsheets to other data
science environments to perform advanced analytics. However, current approaches
for spreadsheet loading suffer from either high runtime or memory usage, which
hinders data exploration on commodity systems. To make spreasheet loading
practical on commodity systems, we introduce a novel parser that minimizes
memory usage by tightly coupling decompression and parsing. Furthermore, to
reduce the runtime, we introduce optimized spreadsheet-specific parsing
routines and employ parallelism. To evaluate our approach, we implement a
prototype for loading Excel spreadsheets into R environments. Our evaluation
shows that our novel approach is up to 3x faster while consuming up to 40x less
memory than state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 由于电子表格的数据模型复杂且可能混乱，因此创建电子表格到RDF知识图的映射过程非常耗时。Spread2RML旨在通过自动预测映射来减少这些工作。

Method: Spread2RML通过将一组合适的RML对象映射模板应用于每一列来预测RML映射，这些模板是根据启发式方法选择的。

Result: 该方法在三个不同混乱程度的数据集上进行了评估，并取得了初步的、有希望的结果，尤其是在处理混乱数据和实现全自动化方面。

Conclusion: Spread2RML通过基于启发式方法的可扩展的RML对象映射模板，实现了对混乱的电子表格的RML映射的自动预测，并在包含各种混乱程度的数据集上获得了有希望的结果。

Abstract: The RDF Mapping Language (RML) allows to map semi-structured data to RDF
knowledge graphs. Besides CSV, JSON and XML, this also includes the mapping of
spreadsheet tables. Since spreadsheets have a complex data model and can become
rather messy, their mapping creation tends to be very time consuming. In order
to reduce such efforts, this paper presents Spread2RML which predicts RML
mappings on messy spreadsheets. This is done with an extensible set of RML
object map templates which are applied for each column based on heuristics. In
our evaluation, three datasets are used ranging from very messy synthetic data
to spreadsheets from data.gov which are less messy. We obtained first promising
results especially with regard to our approach being fully automatic and
dealing with rather messy data.

Abstract: First responders and other forward deployed essential workers can benefit
from advanced analytics. Limited network access and software security
requirements prevent the usage of standard cloud based microservice analytic
platforms that are typically used in industry. One solution is to precompute a
wide range of analytics as files that can be used with standard preinstalled
software that does not require network access or additional software and can
run on a wide range of legacy hardware. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
this approach was tested for providing geo-spatial census data to allow quick
analysis of demographic data for better responding to emergencies. These data
were processed using the MIT SuperCloud to create several thousand Google Earth
and Microsoft Excel files representative of many advanced analytics. The fast
mapping of census data using Google Earth and Microsoft Excel has the potential
to give emergency responders a powerful tool to improve emergency preparedness.
Our approach displays relevant census data (total population, population under
15, population over 65, median age) per census block, sorted by county, through
a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (xlsx file) and Google Earth map (kml file). The
spreadsheet interface includes features that allow users to convert between
different longitude and latitude coordinate units. For the Google Earth files,
a variety of absolute and relative colors maps of population density have been
explored to provide an intuitive and meaningful interface. Using several
hundred cores on the MIT SuperCloud, new analytics can be generated in a few
minutes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommending commonly composed charts in real-world scenarios faces challenges such as efficiency, imbalanced data, and table context. This paper addresses these challenges.

Method: Table2Charts framework uses deep Q-learning with a copying mechanism and heuristic searching to perform table-to-sequence generation, where each sequence follows a chart template. It learns common patterns from a large corpus of (table, charts) pairs.

Result: Table2Charts could learn a shared representation of table fields, enabling recommendation tasks across different chart types to mutually enhance each other. It significantly outperforms other chart recommendation systems.

Conclusion: Table2Charts framework outperforms other chart recommendation systems in both multi-type task and human evaluations, achieving doubled recall numbers (R@3=0.61 and R@1=0.43).

Abstract: It is common for people to create different types of charts to explore a
multi-dimensional dataset (table). However, to recommend commonly composed
charts in real world, one should take the challenges of efficiency, imbalanced
data and table context into consideration. In this paper, we propose
Table2Charts framework which learns common patterns from a large corpus of
(table, charts) pairs. Based on deep Q-learning with copying mechanism and
heuristic searching, Table2Charts does table-to-sequence generation, where each
sequence follows a chart template. On a large spreadsheet corpus with 165k
tables and 266k charts, we show that Table2Charts could learn a shared
representation of table fields so that recommendation tasks on different chart
types could mutually enhance each other. Table2Charts outperforms other chart
recommendation systems in both multi-type task (with doubled recall numbers
R@3=0.61 and R@1=0.43) and human evaluations.

Result: Sigma Worksheet 生成的 SQL 查询在 TPC-H 基准测试中的性能与参考查询相当。用户调查和访谈显示，Sigma Worksheet 易于使用和学习，提高了用户生产力。

Conclusion: Sigma Worksheet 易于使用和学习，提高了用户生产力，但可以通过在数据分析的各个阶段为用户提供指导来进一步改善用户体验。

Abstract: The new generation of cloud data warehouses (CDWs) brings large amounts of
data and compute power closer to users in enterprises. The ability to directly
access the warehouse data, interactively analyze and explore it at scale can
empower users to improve their decision making cycles. However, existing tools
for analyzing data in CDWs are either limited in ad-hoc transformations or
difficult to use for business users, the largest user segment in enterprises.
Here we introduce Sigma Worksheet, a new interactive system that enables users
to easily perform ad-hoc visual analysis of data in CDWs at scale. For this,
Sigma Worksheet provides an accessible spreadsheet-like interface for data
analysis through direct manipulation. Sigma Worksheet dynamically constructs
matching SQL queries from user interactions on this familiar interface,
building on the versatility and expressivity of SQL. Sigma Worksheet executes
constructed queries directly on CDWs, leveraging the superior characteristics
of the new generation CDWs, including scalability. To evaluate Sigma Worksheet,
we first demonstrate its expressivity through two real life use cases, cohort
analysis and sessionization. We then measure the performance of the Worksheet
generated queries with a set of experiments using the TPC-H benchmark. Results
show the performance of our compiled SQL queries is comparable to that of the
reference queries of the benchmark. Finally, to assess the usefulness of Sigma
Worksheet in deployment, we elicit feedback through a 100-person survey
followed by a semi-structured interview study with 70 participants. We find
that Sigma Worksheet is easier to use and learn, improving the productivity of
users. Our findings also suggest Sigma Worksheet can further improve user
experience by providing guidance to users at various steps of data analysis.

Conclusion: 本文介绍了一种名为DataSprout的合成数据生成器，该生成器能够模仿真实电子表格中的11种数据模式，以解决工业场景中缺乏真实标注数据集的问题。

Abstract: Confidentiality hinders the publication of authentic, labeled datasets of
personal and enterprise data, although they could be useful for evaluating
knowledge graph construction approaches in industrial scenarios. Therefore, our
plan is to synthetically generate such data in a way that it appears as
authentic as possible. Based on our assumption that knowledge workers have
certain habits when they produce or manage data, generation patterns could be
discovered which can be utilized by data generators to imitate real datasets.
In this paper, we initially derived 11 distinct patterns found in real
spreadsheets from industry and demonstrate a suitable generator called Data
Sprout that is able to reproduce them. We describe how the generator produces
spreadsheets in general and what altering effects the implemented patterns
have.

*Markus Schröder,Christian Jilek,Michael Schulze,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种交互式方法，通过图形用户界面批量注释电子表格单元格，以构建知识图谱，解决了非结构化数据带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自由输入的电子表格可能包含非结构化内容，难以被机器解释，因此需要将其转换为知识图谱等显式、形式化和结构化的形式。然而，在缺乏数据维护策略的情况下，用户生成的数据会变得混乱，给知识图谱的构建带来挑战。

Method: 提出了一种交互式方法，包括一个图形用户界面，允许知识工程师批量注释提取信息的电子表格单元格。

Result: 使用来自工业场景的五个电子表格，在评估中构建了一个包含 25,000 个三元组的图谱。

Conclusion: 基于对提取信息的单元格注释，最终形成知识图谱。该方法与最新的 RDF 映射语言 (RML) 进行了比较，结果突出了该方法的优势。

Abstract: When spreadsheets are filled freely by knowledge workers, they can contain
rather unstructured content. For humans and especially machines it becomes
difficult to interpret such data properly. Therefore, spreadsheets are often
converted to a more explicit, formal and structured form, for example, to a
knowledge graph. However, if a data maintenance strategy has been missing and
user-generated data becomes "messy", the construction of knowledge graphs will
be a challenging task. In this paper, we catalog several of those challenges
and propose an interactive approach to solve them. Our approach includes a
graphical user interface which enables knowledge engineers to bulk-annotate
spreadsheet cells with extracted information. Based on the cells' annotations a
knowledge graph is ultimately formed. Using five spreadsheets from an
industrial scenario, we built a 25k-triple graph during our evaluation. We
compared our method with the state-of-the-art RDF Mapping Language (RML)
attempt. The comparison highlights contributions of our approach.

Motivation: 现有的文本分析系统通常只支持部分分析阶段，并且难以应对数据异构性、数据来源、工作流可重用性和可复现性以及与既有实践的兼容性等挑战。

Method: 提出了一种名为Leam的系统，该系统具有交互式用户界面、用于管理多种原子和复合数据类型的新型数据模型，以及能够捕获文本分析各个阶段的多种操作并实现数据、代码和可视化等不同系统组件之间协调的表达性代数。

Conclusion: Leam系统通过结合计算笔记本、电子表格和可视化工具的优点，将文本分析过程视为一个单一的连续体，以应对数据异构性、数据来源、工作流可重用性和可复现性以及与既有实践的兼容性等挑战。

Abstract: With the increase in scale and availability of digital text generated on the
web, enterprises such as online retailers and aggregators often use text
analytics to mine and analyze the data to improve their services and products
alike. Text data analysis is an iterative, non-linear process with diverse
workflows spanning multiple stages, from data cleaning to visualization.
Existing text analytics systems usually accommodate a subset of these stages
and often fail to address challenges related to data heterogeneity, provenance,
workflow reusability and reproducibility, and compatibility with established
practices. Based on a set of design considerations we derive from these
challenges, we propose Leam, a system that treats the text analysis process as
a single continuum by combining advantages of computational notebooks,
spreadsheets, and visualization tools. Leam features an interactive user
interface for running text analysis workflows, a new data model for managing
multiple atomic and composite data types, and an expressive algebra that
captures diverse sets of operations representing various stages of text
analysis and enables coordination among different components of the system,
including data, code, and visualizations. We report our current progress in
Leam development while demonstrating its usefulness with usage examples.
Finally, we outline a number of enhancements to Leam and identify several
research directions for developing an interactive visual text analysis system.

TL;DR: ObjTables是一个工具包，它使电子表格具有人类和机器可读性，通过结合模式和对象关系映射系统，从而使研究人员能够重用和组合电子表格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学中的一个中心挑战是从复杂网络中理解系统行为的出现，这通常需要聚合、重用和集成异构信息。文章的补充电子表格是一个关键的数据源。电子表格之所以受欢迎，是因为它们易于读写。然而，电子表格通常难以重新分析，因为它们是临时创建的，没有定义它们所表示的对象、关系和属性的模式。

Method: 开发了一个名为ObjTables的工具包，它结合了模式和对象关系映射系统，使电子表格具有人类和机器可读性。ObjTables包含用于模式的格式、用于指示每个电子表格和列所代表的类别和属性的标记、多种科学信息数据类型以及用于使用模式读取、写入、验证、比较、合并、修订和分析电子表格的高级软件。

Result: ObjTables使电子表格更易于重用，可能实现前所未有的二次元分析。通过轻松构建新格式和相关软件以支持新类型数据，ObjTables还可以加速新兴科学领域。

Conclusion: ObjTables工具包通过结合模式和对象关系映射系统，使电子表格具有人类和机器可读性，从而使研究人员能够重用和组合电子表格，从而实现前所未有的二次元分析，并加速新兴科学领域。

Abstract: A central challenge in science is to understand how systems behaviors emerge
from complex networks. This often requires aggregating, reusing, and
integrating heterogeneous information. Supplementary spreadsheets to articles
are a key data source. Spreadsheets are popular because they are easy to read
and write. However, spreadsheets are often difficult to reanalyze because they
capture data ad hoc without schemas that define the objects, relationships, and
attributes that they represent. To help researchers reuse and compose
spreadsheets, we developed ObjTables, a toolkit that makes spreadsheets human-
and machine-readable by combining spreadsheets with schemas and an
object-relational mapping system. ObjTables includes a format for schemas;
markup for indicating the class and attribute represented by each spreadsheet
and column; numerous data types for scientific information; and high-level
software for using schemas to read, write, validate, compare, merge, revision,
and analyze spreadsheets. By making spreadsheets easier to reuse, ObjTables
could enable unprecedented secondary meta-analyses. By making it easy to build
new formats and associated software for new types of data, ObjTables can also
accelerate emerging scientific fields.

Method: 提出了一种动态分布式维度数据模型（D4M）库，该库在多种语言中实现了结合了电子表格、数据库、矩阵和图属性的关联数组，并针对内存层级结构进行了优化，以支持大规模流式网络数据的流式更新。

Result: 在 MIT SuperCloud 上运行 34,000 个 D4M 关联数组实例，实现了每秒 1,900,000,000 次的持续更新速率。

Conclusion: D4M 库的分布式层次化实现能够支持大规模流式网络数据的分析。

Abstract: Analyzing large scale networks requires high performance streaming updates of
graph representations of these data. Associative arrays are mathematical
objects combining properties of spreadsheets, databases, matrices, and graphs,
and are well-suited for representing and analyzing streaming network data. The
Dynamic Distributed Dimensional Data Model (D4M) library implements associative
arrays in a variety of languages (Python, Julia, and Matlab/Octave) and
provides a lightweight in-memory database. Associative arrays are designed for
block updates. Streaming updates to a large associative array requires a
hierarchical implementation to optimize the performance of the memory
hierarchy. Running 34,000 instances of a hierarchical D4M associative arrays on
1,100 server nodes on the MIT SuperCloud achieved a sustained update rate of
1,900,000,000 updates per second. This capability allows the MIT SuperCloud to
analyze extremely large streaming network data sets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的数据理解实践中，文档通常与数据分离在不同的外部文档、图表、电子表格和工具中，导致了显著的查找开销，并且不利于其他应用程序的利用。

Method: 提出了一种使用单一语义模型将数据与其文档相关联的方法论。

Result: 展示了一个早期原型，以展示该方法论的实际应用。

Conclusion: 该方法论使用单一语义模型将数据与其文档相关联，从而解决了数据理解中数据与文档分离的问题，降低了查找开销，并支持其他数据处理应用。

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, data understanding is the practice of
getting initial insights in unknown datasets. Such knowledge-intensive tasks
require a lot of documentation, which is necessary for data scientists to grasp
the meaning of the data. Usually, documentation is separate from the data in
various external documents, diagrams, spreadsheets and tools which causes
considerable look up overhead. Moreover, other supporting applications are not
able to consume and utilize such unstructured data. That is why we propose a
methodology that uses a single semantic model that interlinks data with its
documentation. Hence, data scientists are able to directly look up the
connected information about the data by simply following links. Equally, they
can browse the documentation which always refers to the data. Furthermore, the
model can be used by other approaches providing additional support, like
searching, comparing, integrating or visualizing data. To showcase our approach
we also demonstrate an early prototype.

### [146] [WebRelate: Integrating Web Data with Spreadsheets using Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05787)
*Jeevana Priya Inala,Rishabh Singh*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: WebRelate simplifies web data integration for users by learning to generate URLs and extract data from webpages using examples, overcoming the complexity of traditional scripting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for joining web data with relational data are complex and require advanced programming expertise, particularly in formulating logic to retrieve data from webpages and extracting relevant information using scripts, which is a barrier for many data scientists and end-users.

Method: WebRelate decomposes the web data integration task into URL learning and input-dependent web extraction. It learns string transformation programs for URL generation and data extraction programs using input-output examples and domain-specific languages.

Result: WebRelate achieves high performance on 88 real-world web data integration tasks, learning the required programs efficiently (within seconds) with minimal examples (often just one).

Conclusion: WebRelate can learn URL generation and web data extraction programs within seconds using only one example for the majority of 88 real-world tasks, addressing the challenge of integrating semi-structured web data with relational data.

Abstract: Data integration between web sources and relational data is a key challenge
faced by data scientists and spreadsheet users. There are two main challenges
in programmatically joining web data with relational data. First, most websites
do not expose a direct interface to obtain tabular data, so the user needs to
formulate a logic to get to different webpages for each input row in the
relational table. Second, after reaching the desired webpage, the user needs to
write complex scripts to extract the relevant data, which is often conditioned
on the input data. Since many data scientists and end-users come from diverse
backgrounds, writing such complex regular-expression based logical scripts to
perform data integration tasks is unfortunately often beyond their programming
expertise.
  We present WebRelate, a system that allows users to join semi-structured web
data with relational data in spreadsheets using input-output examples.
WebRelate decomposes the web data integration task into two sub-tasks of i) URL
learning and ii) input-dependent web extraction. The first sub-task generates
the URLs for the webpages containing the desired data for all rows in the
relational table. WebRelate achieves this by learning a string transformation
program using a few example URLs. The second sub-task uses examples of desired
data to be extracted from the corresponding webpages and learns a program to
extract the data for the other rows. We design expressive domain-specific
languages for URL generation and web data extraction, and present efficient
synthesis algorithms for learning programs in these DSLs from few input-output
examples. We evaluate WebRelate on 88 real-world web data integration tasks
taken from online help forums and Excel product team, and show that WebRelate
can learn the desired programs within few seconds using only 1 example for the
majority of the tasks.

TL;DR: DataSpread通过集成电子表格和数据库，解决了可扩展性和交互性问题，并优化了存储和公式评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的电子表格软件在数据管理方面具有交互性但缺乏可扩展性，而数据库系统虽然可扩展性强但缺乏交互性。为解决此问题，提出了一种名为DataSpread的集成方案，旨在将电子表格作为前端接口与数据库后端结合，实现可扩展的电子表格和交互式数据库。

Method: 通过对电子表格使用情况进行广泛调查来确定功能需求，开发了一种灵活表示电子表格数据的机制，并解决了表示最优化的NP-Hard问题，同时提供了一种常数时间的访问和修改机制。

Result: 所提出的表示方法在存储方面最多可减少20%的存储空间，在公式评估方面最多可减少50%的评估时间。

Conclusion: 开发了一种新的存储引擎，以解决电子表格和数据库之间的不匹配问题，并能在存储和公式评估方面提供显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Spreadsheet software is the tool of choice for interactive ad-hoc data
management, with adoption by billions of users. However, spreadsheets are not
scalable, unlike database systems. On the other hand, database systems, while
highly scalable, do not support interactivity as a first-class primitive. We
are developing DataSpread, to holistically integrate spreadsheets as a
front-end interface with databases as a back-end datastore, providing
scalability to spreadsheets, and interactivity to databases, an integration we
term presentational data management (PDM). In this paper, we make a first step
towards this vision: developing a storage engine for PDM, studying how to
flexibly represent spreadsheet data within a database and how to support and
maintain access by position. We first conduct an extensive survey of
spreadsheet use to motivate our functional requirements for a storage engine
for PDM. We develop a natural set of mechanisms for flexibly representing
spreadsheet data and demonstrate that identifying the optimal representation is
NP-Hard; however, we develop an efficient approach to identify the optimal
representation from an important and intuitive subclass of representations. We
extend our mechanisms with positional access mechanisms that don't suffer from
cascading update issues, leading to constant time access and modification
performance. We evaluate these representations on a workload of typical
spreadsheets and spreadsheet operations, providing up to 20% reduction in
storage, and up to 50% reduction in formula evaluation time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏用于启用智能应用的映射表存储库，因此受到其广泛适用性的启发，研究了使用大型表语料库合成映射关系的问题。

Method: 该方法利用了基于共现统计的表的兼容性以及函数依赖等约束来合成映射关系。

Result: 使用来自Web和企业电子表格的实验结果表明，该方法可以生成高质量的映射。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法可以生成高质量的映射关系。

Abstract: Mapping relationships, such as (country, country-code) or (company,
stock-ticker), are versatile data assets for an array of applications in data
cleaning and data integration like auto-correction and auto-join. However,
today there are no good repositories of mapping tables that can enable these
intelligent applications.
  Given a corpus of tables such as web tables or spreadsheet tables, we observe
that values of these mappings often exist in pairs of columns in same tables.
Motivated by their broad applicability, we study the problem of synthesizing
mapping relationships using a large table corpus. Our synthesis process
leverages compatibility of tables based on co-occurrence statistics, as well as
constraints such as functional dependency. Experiment results using web tables
and enterprise spreadsheets suggest that the proposed approach can produce high
quality mappings.

TL;DR: This paper presents dynamic kernel matching (DKM), a method for modifying statistical classifiers to handle non-conforming data, such as TCR sequences and repertoires. The method was successfully applied to two datasets, showing good performance and identifying patterns consistent with experimental observations.


<details>

Finally, we identify the patterns used by our statistical classifiers to generate predictions and show that these patterns agree with observations from experimental studies.

that both datasets contain signatures for diagnosing disease. We successfully

Motivation: 本文旨在为通过示例进行合成的技术奠定理论基础，特别是针对由结构递归定义的、将代数数据类型映射到字符串的函数。这类函数在程序和数据的可视化打印和序列化等领域具有应用价值。作者希望为非专业用户提供一种便捷的方式来生成程序，只需提供其行为示例。

Method: 本文提出了一种用于合成一组由结构递归定义的函数，这些函数将代数数据类型映射到字符串。作者将该问题形式化为学习具有单个状态的确定性序列自顶向下树到字符串转换器。他们证明了学习这样一个转换器的问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但在满足特定闭包条件时可以在多项式时间内解决。此外，他们还研究了一种主动学习场景，其中算法选择输入，用户提供输出，以确定唯一的转换器。

Result: 研究表明，从任意一组输入/输出示例学习树到字符串转换器的问题在一般情况下是NP完全的。然而，在满足“每个子树也是输入/输出示例的一部分”这一实际可用的闭包条件时，该问题可以在多项式时间内解决。在主动学习场景中，该算法能够以与代数数据类型定义大小成线性的最坏情况查询次数来确定唯一的转换器。

Conclusion: 该算法可以根据用户提供的输入/输出示例集学习树到字符串的转换器，并且在某些条件下（例如，输入/输出示例集中的每个子树也是输入/输出示例的一部分）可以有效解决。此外，该算法还可以通过主动学习的方式，由算法选择输入并由用户提供输出来确定唯一的转换器，所需查询次数与代数数据类型定义的规模成线性关系。

Abstract: Synthesis from examples enables non-expert users to generate programs by
specifying examples of their behavior. A domain-specific form of such synthesis
has been recently deployed in a widely used spreadsheet software product. In
this paper we contribute to foundations of such techniques and present a
complete algorithm for synthesis of a class of recursive functions defined by
structural recursion over a given algebraic data type definition. The functions
we consider map an algebraic data type to a string; they are useful for, e.g.,
pretty printing and serialization of programs and data. We formalize our
problem as learning deterministic sequential top-down tree-to-string
transducers with a single state.
  The first problem we consider is learning a tree-to-string transducer from
any set of input/output examples provided by the user. We show that this
problem is NP-complete in general, but can be solved in polynomial time under a
(practically useful) closure condition that each subtree of a tree in the
input/output example set is also part of the input/output examples.
  Because coming up with relevant input/output examples may be difficult for
the user while creating hard constraint problems for the synthesizer, we also
study a more automated active learning scenario in which the algorithm chooses
the inputs for which the user provides the outputs. Our algorithm asks a
worst-case linear number of queries as a function of the size of the algebraic
data type definition to determine a unique transducer.

Abstract: Non-metric music forms the core of the repertoire in Iranian classical music.
Dastgahi music serves as the underlying theoretical system for both Iranian art
music and certain folk traditions. At the heart of Iranian classical music lies
the radif, a foundational repertoire that organizes melodic material central to
performance and pedagogy.
  In this study, we introduce the first digital corpus representing the
complete non-metrical radif repertoire, covering all 13 existing components of
this repertoire. We provide MIDI files (about 281 minutes in total) and data
spreadsheets describing notes, note durations, intervals, and hierarchical
structures for 228 pieces of music. We faithfully represent the tonality
including quarter-tones, and the non-metric aspect. Furthermore, we provide
supporting basic statistics, and measures of complexity and similarity over the
corpus.
  Our corpus provides a platform for computational studies of Iranian classical
music. Researchers might employ it in studying melodic patterns, investigating
improvisational styles, or for other tasks in music information retrieval,
music theory, and computational (ethno)musicology.

Abstract: Consonance is related to the perception of pleasantness arising from a
combination of sounds and has been approached quantitatively using mathematical
relations, physics, information theory, and psychoacoustics. Tonal consonance
is present in timbre, musical tuning, harmony, and melody, and it is used for
conveying sensations, perceptions, and emotions in music. It involves the
physical properties of sound waves and is used to study melody and harmony
through musical intervals and chords. From the perspective of complexity, the
macroscopic properties of a system with many parts frequently rely on the
statistical properties of its constituent elements. Here we show how the tonal
consonance parameters for complex tones can be used to study complexity in
music. We apply this formalism to melody, showing that melodic lines in musical
pieces can be described in terms of the physical properties of melodic
intervals and the existence of an entropy extremalization principle subject to
psychoacoustic macroscopic constraints with musical meaning. This result
connects the human perception of consonance with the complexity of human
creativity in music through the physical properties of the musical stimulus.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了EXT4, XFS, BtrFS, ZFS和F2FS这几种Linux文件系统在处理大量文件时的性能，并分析了它们的读写吞吐量、存储利用率和性能下降等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据量的爆炸式增长，需要快速处理数据，因此需要将数据尽可能地移近计算设备以减少传输延迟。因此，本地文件系统因其内在机制、性能和局限性而受到关注。

Method: 通过创建、存储和读取十亿个文件来分析EXT4, XFS, BtrFS, ZFS和F2FS这几种流行的Linux文件系统。研究人员还捕获并分析了读/写吞吐量、存储块使用情况、磁盘空间利用率和开销等指标，并探讨了文件系统性能下降等副作用。

Conclusion: 该研究分析了EXT4, XFS, BtrFS, ZFS和F2FS这几种流行的Linux文件系统，通过创建、存储和读取十亿个文件来评估它们。研究人员还分析了读/写吞吐量、存储块使用情况、磁盘空间利用率和开销等指标，并探讨了在创建大量文件和文件夹期间及之后文件系统性能下降等副作用。

Abstract: As the volume of data being produced is increasing at an exponential rate
that needs to be processed quickly, it is reasonable that the data needs to be
available very close to the compute devices to reduce transfer latency. Due to
this need, local filesystems are getting close attention to understand their
inner workings, performance, and more importantly their limitations. This study
analyzes few popular Linux filesystems: EXT4, XFS, BtrFS, ZFS, and F2FS by
creating, storing, and then reading back one billion files from the local
filesystem. The study also captured and analyzed read/write throughput, storage
blocks usage, disk space utilization and overheads, and other metrics useful
for system designers and integrators. Furthermore, the study explored other
side effects such as filesystem performance degradation during and after these
large numbers of files and folders are created.

TL;DR: Hillview is a distributed spreadsheet for massive datasets, using 'vizketches' for fast, interactive visualization and analysis, scaling far beyond existing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to create an interactive spreadsheet system, Hillview, that can browse and analyze very large datasets that exceed the capacity of a single machine, while maintaining a high degree of interactivity for data exploration.

Method: Hillview utilizes 'vizketches,' which are compact data visualizations combining data summarization algorithms and efficient rendering techniques. This approach enables parallel computation, reduced communication, progressive visualization, and precise accuracy guarantees, allowing it to scale effectively.

Result: Hillview, running on eight servers, successfully navigates and visualizes datasets with tens of billions of rows and trillions of cells, outperforming published capabilities of competing systems.

Conclusion: Hillview is a distributed spreadsheet capable of handling massive datasets (tens of billions of rows, trillions of cells) beyond competing systems, due to its innovative vizsketch approach.

Abstract: Hillview is a distributed spreadsheet for browsing very large datasets that
cannot be handled by a single machine. As a spreadsheet, Hillview provides a
high degree of interactivity that permits data analysts to explore information
quickly along many dimensions while switching visualizations on a whim. To
provide the required responsiveness, Hillview introduces visualization
sketches, or vizketches, as a simple idea to produce compact data
visualizations. Vizketches combine algorithmic techniques for data
summarization with computer graphics principles for efficient rendering. While
simple, vizketches are effective at scaling the spreadsheet by parallelizing
computation, reducing communication, providing progressive visualizations, and
offering precise accuracy guarantees. Using Hillview running on eight servers,
we can navigate and visualize datasets of tens of billions of rows and
trillions of cells, much beyond the published capabilities of competing
systems.

TL;DR: D4M 库的层次化实现显著提高了处理网络数据的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析海量网络数据对 D4M 库的内存层级和更新速率带来了巨大压力，需要进行优化。

Method: 通过实现层次化关联数组来优化 D4M 库，通过控制层级条目数量来管理内存和更新。

Result: 层次化数组在单实例中达到每秒 40,000 次更新，在 1,100 个服务器节点上扩展到 34,000 个实例时，实现了每秒 1,900,000,000 次更新。

Conclusion: D4M 库的层次化实现通过减少内存压力和提高更新速率，能够处理海量流式网络数据。

Abstract: The Dynamic Distributed Dimensional Data Model (D4M) library implements
associative arrays in a variety of languages (Python, Julia, and Matlab/Octave)
and provides a lightweight in-memory database implementation of hypersparse
arrays that are ideal for analyzing many types of network data. D4M relies on
associative arrays which combine properties of spreadsheets, databases,
matrices, graphs, and networks, while providing rigorous mathematical
guarantees, such as linearity. Streaming updates of D4M associative arrays put
enormous pressure on the memory hierarchy. This work describes the design and
performance optimization of an implementation of hierarchical associative
arrays that reduces memory pressure and dramatically increases the update rate
into an associative array. The parameters of hierarchical associative arrays
rely on controlling the number of entries in each level in the hierarchy before
an update is cascaded. The parameters are easily tunable to achieve optimal
performance for a variety of applications. Hierarchical arrays achieve over
40,000 updates per second in a single instance. Scaling to 34,000 instances of
hierarchical D4M associative arrays on 1,100 server nodes on the MIT SuperCloud
achieved a sustained update rate of 1,900,000,000 updates per second. This
capability allows the MIT SuperCloud to analyze extremely large streaming
network data sets.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with complex spreadsheet tasks requiring logical reasoning; a new benchmark, FLARE, is introduced to evaluate and improve their performance in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the underexplored effectiveness of LLMs in spreadsheet-related tasks and address their limitations in handling precise logical reasoning.

Method: Introduced a foundation for a comprehensive benchmark framework to evaluate LLM performance in spreadsheet functions, formula generation, and data manipulation. Developed FLARE (Formula Logic, Auditing, Reasoning and Evaluation) benchmark for real-world spreadsheet logic, auditing, and reasoning tasks.

Result: LLMs show proficiency in straightforward spreadsheet tasks but frequently falter in complex, multi-step operations, generating plausible but incorrect outputs.

Conclusion: LLMs are proficient in simple spreadsheet tasks but struggle with complex, multi-step operations, producing plausible but incorrect outputs. This highlights the need for integrating symbolic reasoning capabilities into LLM architectures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated some significant capabilities
across various domains; however, their effectiveness in spreadsheet related
tasks remains underexplored. This study introduces a foundation for a
comprehensive benchmark framework to evaluate the performance of leading LLMs
in executing spreadsheet functions, formula generation and data manipulation
tasks. The benchmark encompasses tasks ranging from basic formula creation to
complex, real world spreadsheet scenarios. Our findings reveal that while LLMs
exhibit proficiency in straightforward tasks, they often falter in complex,
multi step operations, frequently producing plausible yet incorrect outputs.
These results underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling
spreadsheet tasks that require precise logical reasoning and highlight the need
for integrating symbolic reasoning capabilities into LLM architectures. To
support this, we introduce FLARE (Formula Logic, Auditing, Reasoning and
Evaluation) a new benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on real-world
spreadsheet logic, auditing, and reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: TableTalk 是一个对话式电子表格助手，可提高效率并降低认知负荷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于电子表格编程需要电子表格特定知识和解决问题能力，对程序员来说仍然具有挑战性。LLM 和语言智能体可以帮助自动化这一过程。

Method: TableTalk 是一个语言智能体，通过分步计划和提供下一步建议来构建电子表格，并集成工具以实现增量式构建。

Result: 与基线智能体相比，TableTalk 产生的电子表格更受用户青睐（2.3 倍），同时认知负荷和推理时间减少了 12.6%。

Conclusion: TableTalk 的方法对人与智能体协作有启示，包括为中止或撤销智能体操作提供持久的直接操作界面，同时确保可以禁用用于接受操作的此类界面。

Abstract: Despite its ubiquity in the workforce, spreadsheet programming remains
challenging as programmers need both spreadsheet-specific knowledge (e.g., APIs
to write formulas) and problem-solving skills to create complex spreadsheets.
Large language models (LLMs) can help automate aspects of this process, and
recent advances in planning and reasoning have enabled language agents, which
dynamically plan, use tools, and take iterative actions to complete complex
tasks. These agents observe, plan, and act, making them well-suited to scaffold
spreadsheet programming by following expert processes.
  We present TableTalk, a language agent that helps programmers build
spreadsheets conversationally. Its design reifies three design principles --
scaffolding, flexibility, and incrementality -- which we derived from two
studies of seven programmers and 62 Excel templates. TableTalk structures
spreadsheet development by generating step-by-step plans and suggesting three
next steps users can choose from. It also integrates tools that enable
incremental spreadsheet construction. A user study with 20 programmers shows
that TableTalk produces spreadsheets 2.3 times more likely to be preferred over
a baseline agent, while reducing cognitive load and time spent reasoning about
spreadsheet actions by 12.6%. TableTalk's approach has implications for
human-agent collaboration. This includes providing persistent direct
manipulation interfaces for stopping or undoing agent actions, while ensuring
that such interfaces for accepting actions can be deactivated.

TL;DR: 一种新的文本驱动方法，利用源文件（如 .xlsx, .pptx, .docx）中的元数据来提取图表信息，并通过大型语言模型（LLM）进行分析，以提高图表理解的准确性，优于传统的视觉语言模型（VLM）方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决在商业文档中准确识别和提取图表结构与关系方面的挑战，克服现有视觉语言模型（VLM）在处理此类任务时的局限性。

Method: 提出了一种文本驱动的方法，利用可编辑的源文件（如 xlsx、pptx、docx）中保留的文本元数据来提取图表信息，并将提取的形状数据转换为文本输入，供大型语言模型（LLM）进行分析和问答，从而绕过对 VLM 视觉识别能力的依赖。

Result: 通过将 xlsx 文件中的图表信息提取为文本输入，大型语言模型（LLM）能够分析关系并回答业务问题，其准确性优于基于 VLM 的方法。该方法可扩展至其他包含源文件的图表格式，如 pptx 和 docx。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的文本驱动框架通过直接从源文件提取图表信息，能够更准确地回答需要详细理解图表结构的问题，证明了绕过视觉语言模型（VLM）限制的可行性，并为提高实际业务场景中的工作流程效率和信息分析能力提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Diagrams play a crucial role in visually conveying complex relationships and
processes within business documentation. Despite recent advances in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for various image understanding tasks, accurately
identifying and extracting the structures and relationships depicted in
diagrams continues to pose significant challenges. This study addresses these
challenges by proposing a text-driven approach that bypasses reliance on VLMs'
visual recognition capabilities. Instead, it utilizes the editable source
files--such as xlsx, pptx or docx--where diagram elements (e.g., shapes, lines,
annotations) are preserved as textual metadata. In our proof-of-concept, we
extracted diagram information from xlsx-based system design documents and
transformed the extracted shape data into textual input for Large Language
Models (LLMs). This approach allowed the LLM to analyze relationships and
generate responses to business-oriented questions without the bottleneck of
image-based processing. Experimental comparisons with a VLM-based method
demonstrated that the proposed text-driven framework yielded more accurate
answers for questions requiring detailed comprehension of diagram
structures.The results obtained in this study are not limited to the tested
.xlsx files but can also be extended to diagrams in other documents with source
files, such as Office pptx and docx formats. These findings highlight the
feasibility of circumventing VLM constraints through direct textual extraction
from original source files. By enabling robust diagram understanding through
LLMs, our method offers a promising path toward enhanced workflow efficiency
and information analysis in real-world business scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究调查了软件工程领域中基础模型（FM）排行榜的运作情况，发现存在“排行榜异味”阻碍了透明度和有效的模型选择。研究人员收集并分析了大量排行榜数据，识别出五种工作流程模式和八种异味类型，并提出通过缓解这些异味来改进排行榜的运作，以促进更负责任的 FM 生态系统。

Motivation: 为了应对缺乏基础模型（FM）评估和比较的标准化指南所带来的挑战，本研究旨在理解 FM 排行榜在现实场景中的运作方式（“排行榜运作”）并识别潜在的陷阱和改进领域（“排行榜异味”）。

Method: 通过收集来自 GitHub、Hugging Face Spaces、Papers With Code、电子表格和独立平台的 1,045 个 FM 排行榜，检查其文档并与排行榜运营者进行直接沟通，以了解其工作流程。通过卡片分类和协商一致，确定了五种不同的工作流程模式，并开发了一个领域模型来捕获这些工作流程中的关键组件及其交互。随后，在 LBOps 中识别出八种独特的排行榜异味。

Result: 确定了五种不同的工作流程模式，并开发了一个领域模型来捕获这些工作流程中的关键组件及其交互。此外，还识别出 LBOps 中的八种独特的排行榜异味。

Conclusion: 通过识别和缓解“排行榜异味”，软件工程（SE）团队可以提高“排行榜运作”（LBOps）实践的透明度、可信度和协作性，从而为“基础模型”（FM）的比较和选择建立一个更强大、更负责任的生态系统。

Abstract: Foundation models (FM), such as large language models (LLMs), which are
large-scale machine learning (ML) models, have demonstrated remarkable
adaptability in various downstream software engineering (SE) tasks, such as
code completion, code understanding, and software development. As a result, FM
leaderboards have become essential tools for SE teams to compare and select the
best third-party FMs for their specific products and purposes. However, the
lack of standardized guidelines for FM evaluation and comparison threatens the
transparency of FM leaderboards and limits stakeholders' ability to perform
effective FM selection. As a first step towards addressing this challenge, our
research focuses on understanding how these FM leaderboards operate in
real-world scenarios ("leaderboard operations") and identifying potential
pitfalls and areas for improvement ("leaderboard smells"). In this regard, we
collect up to 1,045 FM leaderboards from five different sources: GitHub,
Hugging Face Spaces, Papers With Code, spreadsheet and independent platform, to
examine their documentation and engage in direct communication with leaderboard
operators to understand their workflows. Through card sorting and negotiated
agreement, we identify five distinct workflow patterns and develop a domain
model that captures the key components and their interactions within these
workflows. We then identify eight unique types of leaderboard smells in LBOps.
By mitigating these smells, SE teams can improve transparency, accountability,
and collaboration in current LBOps practices, fostering a more robust and
responsible ecosystem for FM comparison and selection.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出MaxMind模型，通过记忆循环网络和知识精度分割增强RAG，提升LLM在软件操作和工具生成（SOTG）中的效率和成功率，并解决了模型重训问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究在将实时任务经验转化为系统记忆以及区分现有知识的未来参考价值方面存在不足。大型语言模型在软件操作和工具生成（SOTG）方面的应用潜力巨大，但这些复杂任务需要AI能够持续地总结和改进，而现有的方法忽略了记忆和知识价值区分的重要性。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为MaxMind的新方法，通过演化外部记忆模型为记忆循环网络（Memory-Loop Networks），实现了实时的记忆和经验引用。同时，增强了检索增强生成（RAG）机制，引入知识精度分割，实现了基于价值差异化的记忆利用。并据此设计了MaxMind模型用于SOTG。

Result: MaxMind4Sheet（一个电子表格处理系统）的实验结果表明，与SheetCopilot相比，任务记忆的积累和再利用能够稳步提高任务成功率（约3%-6%），并将系统任务执行效率提升高达25%。此外，记忆迁移能够解决LLM在处理专业任务时的重新训练问题。

Conclusion: MaxMind通过持续的任务记忆积累和再利用，显著提高了大型语言模型在软件操作和工具生成（SOTG）方面的能力和生产力，能够逐步提升任务成功率（约3%-6%），并将任务执行效率提升高达25%，同时通过记忆迁移解决了LLM在处理专业任务时面临的重新训练问题。

Abstract: The application of large language models to facilitate automated software
operations and tool generation (SOTG), thus augmenting software productivity,
mirrors the early stages of human evolution when the ability to create and use
tools accelerated the progress of civilization. These complex tasks require AI
to continuously summarize and improve. Current research often overlooks the
importance of converting real-time task experiences into system memory and
differentiating the value of existing knowledge for future reference. This
paper addresses these issues by evolving external memory models into
Memory-Loop Networks for timely memorization and experience referencing. We
also enhance a RAG mechanism with knowledge precision segmentation to utilize
memory based on value differentiation, and design the MaxMind model for SOTG
accordingly.To demonstrate our approach, we developed MaxMind4Sheet, an
electronic spreadsheet processing system aligned with the MaxMind philosophy.
Comparative experiments with SheetCopilot have demonstrated that the
accumulation and recycling of task memories lead to a steady enhancement in
task success rate, with an improvement rate of approximately 3%-6% per round in
this implementation example. Note that as the memories continue to grow, this
cumulative improvement may be substantial. The inclusion of memory recycling
can also boost the system's task execution efficiency by up to 25%, and it can
address the retraining issue faced by LLMs when handling specialized tasks
through memories transfer.These suggest that MaxMind has significant potential
to enhance the capabilities and productivity of LLM systems in SOTG.

TL;DR: 电子表格的动态数组技术有望提高其在专业应用中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格虽然直观易用，但容易出错，不适合严谨的分析或建模。先前研究表明，使用 CSE 数组公式可以提高透明度，但过程繁琐。新的动态数组技术的出现为解决这些问题提供了新的途径。

Method: 本研究检验了动态数组在更专业的开发环境中取代传统技术以确保解决方案完整性的可能性。

Result: 新的动态数组技术可能取代传统技术，因为它们需要更少的手动干预来更新，从而降低了错误和风险。

Conclusion: 电子表格的动态数组为提高解决方案的完整性提供了一种更专业、更易于维护的方法，有可能减少错误和风险。

Abstract: Spreadsheets offer a supremely successful and intuitive means of processing
and exchanging numerical content. Its intuitive ad-hoc nature makes it hugely
popular for use in diverse areas including business and engineering, yet these
very same characteristics make it extraordinarily error-prone; many would
question whether it is suitable for serious analysis or modelling tasks. A
previous EuSpRIG paper examined the role of Names in increasing solution
transparency and providing a readable notation to forge links with the problem
domain. Extensive use was made of CSE array formulas, but it is acknowledged
that their use makes spreadsheet development a distinctly cumbersome task.
Since that time, the new dynamic arrays have been introduced and array
calculation is now the default mode of operation for Excel. This paper examines
the thesis that their adoption within a more professional development
environment could replace traditional techniques where solution integrity is
important. A major advantage of fully dynamic models is that they require less
manual intervention to keep them updated and so have the potential to reduce
the attendant errors and risk.

Motivation: Excel 普及了数据处理，但其结构限制了复杂问题的可扩展性。

Method: 本文提出了一种通过一系列公式来解决问题的策略，这些公式类似于编程语言的步骤。

Result: 该方法利用了有争议或鲜为人用的技术，以创建一种类似编程语言的有序解决方案。

Conclusion: Excel 缺少可扩展的结构，这会随着错误的累积而导致问题。

Abstract: Spreadsheets offer a supremely successful democratisation platform, placing
the manipulation and presentation of numbers within the grasp of users that
have little or no mathematical expertise or IT experience. What appears to be
almost completely lacking within a "normal" solution built using Excel default
settings is the deployment of any structure that extends beyond a single-cell
formula. The structural elements that allow conventional code to scale without
escalating errors appear to be absent. This paper considers the use of
controversial or lesser-used techniques to create a coherent solution strategy
in which the problem is solved by a sequence of formulas resembling the steps
of a programmed language.

Conclusion: 本研究通过在形式化规约和被检查的需求中利用变异性，促进了实时规约变体的模型检查。

Abstract: Model checking real-time systems is complex, and requires a careful trade-off
between including enough detail to be useful and not too much detail to avoid
state explosion. This work exploits variability of the formal model being
analysed and the requirements being checked, to facilitate the model-checking
of variations of real-time specifications. This work results from the
collaboration between academics and Alstom, a railway company with a concrete
use-case, in the context of the VALU3S European project. The configuration of
the variability of the formal specifications is described in MS Excel
spreadsheets with a particular structure, making it easy to use also by
developers. These spreadsheets are processed automatically by our prototype
tool that generates instances and runs the model checker. We propose the
extension of our previous work by exploiting analysis over valid combination of
features, while preserving the simplicity of a spreadsheet-based interface with
the model checker.

Motivation: Addresses the need for automating repetitive and error-prone computer end-user tasks like tabular data processing and project timeline scheduling, which most users lack the skill to do.

Method: Proposes SheetCopilot agent, an atomic actions abstraction, and a state machine-based task planning framework for LLMs. Curates a dataset of 221 spreadsheet control tasks and an automated evaluation pipeline.

Result: SheetCopilot correctly completes 44.3% of tasks in a single generation, significantly outperforming the code generation baseline.

Conclusion: SheetCopilot agent can control spreadsheets with natural language, outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Computer end users have spent billions of hours completing daily tasks like
tabular data processing and project timeline scheduling. Most of these tasks
are repetitive and error-prone, yet most end users lack the skill to automate
these burdensome works. With the advent of large language models (LLMs),
directing software with natural language user requests become a reachable goal.
In this work, we propose a SheetCopilot agent that takes natural language task
and control spreadsheet to fulfill the requirements. We propose a set of atomic
actions as an abstraction of spreadsheet software functionalities. We further
design a state machine-based task planning framework for LLMs to robustly
interact with spreadsheets. We curate a representative dataset containing 221
spreadsheet control tasks and establish a fully automated evaluation pipeline
for rigorously benchmarking the ability of LLMs in software control tasks. Our
SheetCopilot correctly completes 44.3\% of tasks for a single generation,
outperforming the strong code generation baseline by a wide margin. Our project

to the art of building spreadsheet solutions. This paper will show the ad-hoc
end user practices of traditional spreadsheets can be replaced by radically
different approaches that have far more in common with formal programming. It

Abstract: This paper presents a taxonomy for analytical spreadsheet models. It
considers both the use case that a spreadsheet is meant to serve, and the
engineering resources devoted to its development. We extend a previous
three-type taxonomy, to identify nine types of spreadsheet models, that
encompass the many analytical spreadsheet models seen in the literature. We
connect disparate research literature to distinguish between an "analytical
solution" and an "industrial-quality analytical spreadsheet model". We explore
the nature of each of the nine types, propose definitions for some, relate them
to the literature, and hypothesize on how they might arise. The taxonomy aids
in identifying where various spreadsheet development guidelines are most
useful, provides a lens for viewing spreadsheet errors and risk, and offers a
structure for understanding how spreadsheets change over time. This taxonomy
opens the door to many interesting research questions, including refinements to
itself.

Method: 本论文提出了一系列使用 ChatGPT 的实验，以探索该工具在需要推断、推理和解决问题的英语句子解读后，生成有效的电子表格公式和相关计算输出的能力。

Result: 结果表明，在某些情况下，ChatGPT 能够通过正确的推理、推断和进行，生成正确的电子表格公式。

Conclusion: 当信息有限、不确定或问题过于复杂时，ChatGPT 的准确性会下降，其推理、推断和演绎能力也会随之下降。这也会导致错误的陈述和“幻觉”，破坏了创建电子表格公式的过程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have become sophisticated enough that complex
computer programs can be created through interpretation of plain English
sentences and implemented in a variety of modern languages such as Python, Java
Script, C++ and Spreadsheets. These tools are powerful and relatively accurate
and therefore provide broad access to computer programming regardless of the
background or knowledge of the individual using them. This paper presents a
series of experiments with ChatGPT to explore the tool's ability to produce
valid spreadsheet formulae and related computational outputs in situations
where ChatGPT has to deduce, infer and problem solve the answer. The results
show that in certain circumstances, ChatGPT can produce correct spreadsheet
formulae with correct reasoning, deduction and inference. However, when
information is limited, uncertain or the problem is too complex, the accuracy
of ChatGPT breaks down as does its ability to reason, infer and deduce. This
can also result in false statements and "hallucinations" that all subvert the
process of creating spreadsheet formulae.

*Mukul Singh,Jose Cambronero,Sumit Gulwani,Vu Le,Carina Negreanu,Gust Verbruggen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CORNET is an Excel add-in that learns formatting rules from examples, automating a tedious manual process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users manually write conditional formatting rules in spreadsheet software, which can be tedious. CORNET aims to automate this process.

Method: CORNET combines symbolic rule enumeration (using semi-supervised clustering and iterative decision tree learning) with a neural ranker to generate accurate conditional formatting rules.

Result: CORNET generates formatting rule suggestions based on user-provided examples, demonstrated as an Excel add-in.

Conclusion: CORNET can automatically learn conditional formatting rules from user examples, reducing manual effort for users.

Abstract: Data management and analysis tasks are often carried out using spreadsheet
software. A popular feature in most spreadsheet platforms is the ability to
define data-dependent formatting rules. These rules can express actions such as
"color red all entries in a column that are negative" or "bold all rows not
containing error or failure." Unfortunately, users who want to exercise this
functionality need to manually write these conditional formatting (CF) rules.
We introduce CORNET, a system that automatically learns such conditional
formatting rules from user examples. CORNET takes inspiration from inductive
program synthesis and combines symbolic rule enumeration, based on
semi-supervised clustering and iterative decision tree learning, with a neural
ranker to produce accurate conditional formatting rules. In this demonstration,
we show CORNET in action as a simple add-in to Microsoft Excel. After the user
provides one or two formatted cells as examples, CORNET generates formatting
rule suggestions for the user to apply to the spreadsheet.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种创建电子表格抽象中间表示（AIR）的工具，以解决从电子表格迁移到Python等科学编程语言时丢失依赖关系信息的问题，并构建了一个Python库用于数据分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格被广泛用于进行大量的数值分析，但许多公司在数据分析方面，特别是数据科学领域，正逐渐转向使用Python等科学编程语言。然而，在迁移过程中，一些信息，如单元格的公式和依赖关系，会丢失。

Method: 提出一个创建电子表格抽象中间表示（AIR）的工具，以方便将电子表格迁移到科学编程语言（如Python）并保留数据间的依赖关系信息。

Result: 创建了一个电子表格的抽象中间表示（AIR），并构建了一个基于该AIR的Python库，以在Python中进行数据分析，同时保留了数据间的依赖关系信息。

Conclusion: 该工具能够保留电子表格中的依赖关系信息，并建立了一个Python库，用于在Python中进行数据分析。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are widely used in various fields to do large numerical
analysis. While several companies have relied on spreadsheets for decades, data
scientists are going in the direction of using scientific programming languages
such as python to do their data analysis due to the support, community, and
vast amount of libraries. While using python to analyze a company's
spreadsheets, some information such as the formulas and dependencies of a cell
are lost. We propose a tool that creates an abstract intermediate
representation (AIR) of a spreadsheet. This representation facilitates the
transfer from spreadsheets into scientific programming languages while
preserving inter-dependency information about data. In addition to that, we
build a python library on top of our tool to perform some data analysis in
python.

findings indicate that the proliferation of spreadsheets in the organization
has provided an enabling environment for business automation. The paper also
highlights management, technological and human factor issues contributing to
high risks associated with the pervasive spreadsheet use. The conclusions drawn
from the research confirms that there is ample room for improvement in many
areas such as implementation of comprehensive policies and regulations
governing spreadsheet development processes and adoption.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种评估研究软件领域软件开发实践状况的方法，并提供了相应的工具和模板。

Abstract: To improve software development methods and tools for research software, we
first need to understand the current state of the practice. Therefore, we have
developed a methodology for assessing the state of the software development
practices for a given research software domain. For each domain we wish to
answer questions such as: i) What artifacts (documents, code, test cases, etc.)
are present? ii) What tools are used? iii) What principles, process and
methodologies are used? iv) What are the pain points for developers? v) What
actions are used to improve qualities like maintainability and reproducibility?
To answer these questions, our methodology prescribes the following steps: i)
Identify the domain; ii) Identify a list of candidate software packages; iii)
Filter the list to a length of about 30 packages; iv) Gather source code and
documentation for each package; v) Collect repository related data on each
software package, like number of stars, number of open issues, number of lines
of code; vi) Fill in the measurement template (the template consists of 108
questions to assess 9 qualities (including the qualities of installability,
usability and visibility)); vii) Interview developers (the interview consists
of 20 questions and takes about an hour); viii) Rank the software using the
Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); and, ix) Analyze the data to answer the
questions posed above. A domain expert should be engaged throughout the
process, to ensure that implicit information about the domain is properly
represented and to assist with conducting an analysis of the commonalities and
variabilities between the 30 selected packages. Using our methodology,
spreadsheet templates and AHP tool, we estimate (based on our experience with
using the process) the time to complete an assessment for a given domain at 173
person hours.

Motivation: 以往研究对敏捷软件开发中可扩展性需求获取的描述不足且复杂，需要更轻量级的方法。

Method: 采用设计科学研究方法，结合协调理论，提出并验证了ScrumScale模型（一个简单的电子表格），用于获取可扩展性需求。

Result: ScrumScale模型被证明能系统性地生成可扩展性需求，并在开放银行案例研究中（涉及55小时的需求获取）显示出优势，提高了利益相关者之间的沟通效率。

Conclusion: ScrumScale模型为敏捷软件开发提供了简化的可扩展性需求获取方法，并在开放银行案例研究中得到了验证，为利益相关者对话提供了优势。

Abstract: Eliciting scalability requirements during agile software development is
complicated and poorly described in previous research. This article presents a
lightweight artifact for eliciting scalability requirements during agile
software development: the ScrumScale model. The ScrumScale model is a simple
spreadsheet. The scalability concepts underlying the ScrumScale model are
clarified in this design science research, which also utilizes coordination
theory. This paper describes the open banking case study, where a legacy
banking system becomes open. This challenges the scalability of this legacy
system. The first step in understanding this challenge is to elicit the new
scalability requirements. In the open banking case study, key stakeholders from
TietoEVRY spent 55 hours eliciting TietoEVRY's open banking project's
scalability requirements. According to TietoEVRY, the ScrumScale model provided
a systematic way of producing scalability requirements. For TietoEVRY, the
scalability concepts behind the ScrumScale model also offered significant
advantages in dialogues with other stakeholders.

TL;DR: SpreadsheetCoder利用表格的行列上下文（包括表头）来合成电子表格公式，在准确性和用户辅助方面均优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的表格公式合成方法未能充分利用真实表格中的丰富上下文，例如表头和非独立的行列数据。

Method: 提出了一种名为SpreadsheetCoder的基于BERT的模型架构，该模型以行和列为基础表示表格上下文。

Result: SpreadsheetCoder实现了42.51%的Top-1预测准确率，显著优于未使用丰富表格上下文的基线模型。

Conclusion: SpreadsheetCoder在Google表格中辅助了82%的公式组合用户，相比基于规则的系统有所提升。

Abstract: Spreadsheet formula prediction has been an important program synthesis
problem with many real-world applications. Previous works typically utilize
input-output examples as the specification for spreadsheet formula synthesis,
where each input-output pair simulates a separate row in the spreadsheet.
However, this formulation does not fully capture the rich context in real-world
spreadsheets. First, spreadsheet data entries are organized as tables, thus
rows and columns are not necessarily independent from each other. In addition,
many spreadsheet tables include headers, which provide high-level descriptions
of the cell data. However, previous synthesis approaches do not consider
headers as part of the specification. In this work, we present the first
approach for synthesizing spreadsheet formulas from tabular context, which
includes both headers and semi-structured tabular data. In particular, we
propose SpreadsheetCoder, a BERT-based model architecture to represent the
tabular context in both row-based and column-based formats. We train our model
on a large dataset of spreadsheets, and demonstrate that SpreadsheetCoder
achieves top-1 prediction accuracy of 42.51%, which is a considerable
improvement over baselines that do not employ rich tabular context. Compared to
the rule-based system, SpreadsheetCoder assists 82% more users in composing
formulas on Google Sheets.

Result: 大多数参与者采用投影策略，少数参与者采用数据库方法，后者公式更简单。

Conclusion: Excel开发者在实现多维变量电子表格时，主要采用了两种策略：将多维变量投影到二维平面，或使用数据库方法。数据库方法能简化公式。

Abstract: Seasoned Excel developers were invited to participate in a challenge to
implement a spreadsheet with multi-dimensional variables. We analyzed their
spreadsheet to see the different implement strategies employed. We identified
two strategies: most participants used a projection of three or
four-dimensional variables on the two-dimensional plane used by Excel. A few
participants used a database approach where the multi-dimensional variables are
presented in the form of a dataset table with the appropriate primary key. This
approach leads to simpler formulas.

TL;DR: 提高电子表格抽象级别的新方法，通过图重构和单元格边界重绘来减少错误，并更好地反映用户模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的电子表格容易出错，因为其抽象级别低，用户被迫使用低级的单元格来构建数据模型，而单元格的功能有限且链接隐藏。

Method: 将电子表格转换为细粒度图，将操作符和值作为节点，将单元格表示为包含一组操作符/数据节点的超图边。通过识别常见子表达式和应用子树同构来检测向量（数组）操作。

Result: 说明了通过识别常见子表达式和子树同构来检测向量（数组）操作的方法，以提高电子表格的抽象级别。

Conclusion: 通过将电子表格转换为细粒度图，并允许单元格包含更多内容，可以提高电子表格的抽象级别，使其更忠实地反映最终用户的模型。

Abstract: We believe the error prone nature of traditional spreadsheets is due to their
low level of abstraction. End user programmers are forced to construct their
data models from low level cells which we define as "a data container or
manipulator linked by user-intent to model their world and positioned to
reflect its structure". Spreadsheet cells are limited in what they may contain
(scalar values) and the links between them are inherently hidden. This paper
proposes a method of raising the level of abstraction of spreadsheets by
"redrawing the boundary" of the cell. To expose the hidden linkage structure we
transform spreadsheets into fine-grained graphs with operators and values as
nodes. "cells" are then represented as hypergraph edges by drawing a boundary
"wall" around a set of operator/data nodes. To extend what cells may contain
and to create a higher level model of the spreadsheet we propose that
researchers should seek techniques to redraw these boundaries to create higher
level "cells" which will more faithfully represent the end-user's real
world/mental model. We illustrate this approach via common sub-expression
identification and the application of sub-tree isomorphisms for the detection
of vector (array) operations.

TL;DR: A coding-free method for developing data management systems using SaaS architecture and a requirements table in spreadsheet has been developed and proven feasible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises intend to deploy data management systems in the cloud, but it is difficult for non-programmers to develop such systems. SaaS has made coding-free software development more feasible.

Method: Based on the SaaS architecture, this paper presents a set of theory and method for coding-free construction of a data management system, which involves a practical application platform, a set of construction method, and a set of interface on data exchange. The platform abstracts common features of data management systems to generate customized system instances, and the method uses a requirements table in spreadsheet to develop the system. The platform maps the requirements table into a system instance by parsing the table model and implementing the objective system.

Result: A universal web platform and a method for coding-free development of data management systems were implemented and deployed on the web. Empirical results showed the method is feasible and available.

Conclusion: The empirical result demonstrates the feasibility and availability of the coding-free method in developing web data management systems.

Abstract: More and more enterprises recently intend to deploy data management systems
in the cloud. Due to the professionalism of software development, it has still
been difficult for non-programmers to develop this kind of systems, even a
small one. However, the development of SaaS brings forth the more feasibility
of coding-free software development than before. Based on the SaaS
architecture, this paper presents a set of theory and method for coding-free
construction of a data management system, on which our contributions involve in
a practical application platform, a set of construction method and a set of
interface on data exchange. By abstracting the common features of data
management systems, we design a universal web platform to quickly generate and
publish customized system instances. Moreover, we propose a kind of method to
develop a data management system using a specific requirements table in
spreadsheet. The corresponding platform maps the requirements table into a
system instance through parsing the table model and implementing the objective
system in the running stage. Finally, we implement the proposed framework and
deploy it on web. The empirical result demonstrates the feasibility and
availability of the coding-free method in developing web data management
systems.

Motivation: 现有的电子表格“坏味道”检测技术存在报告不准确或冗余的问题，例如将同一个问题报告给多个单元格，使用户不知所措。

Method: 提出了一种静态分析方法来推断相关单元格的簇和块，并基于这些结构信息改进了现有的“坏味道”检测技术，同时提出了三种新的基于结构信息的坏味道检测技术。

Result: 实验评估表明，所提出的改进措施能有效减少错误和冗余的坏味道报告数量，并且新提出的坏味道检测技术能够发现新的问题。

Conclusion: 该研究通过利用推断出的结构信息来改进电子表格的“坏味道”检测，成功减少了错误和冗余的坏味道报告，并揭示了新的潜在问题。

Abstract: Spreadsheet users are often unaware of the risks imposed by poorly designed
spreadsheets. One way to assess spreadsheet quality is to detect smells which
attempt to identify parts of spreadsheets that are hard to comprehend or
maintain and which are more likely to be the root source of bugs.
Unfortunately, current spreadsheet smell detection techniques suffer from a
number of drawbacks that lead to incorrect or redundant smell reports. For
example, the same quality issue is often reported for every copy of a cell,
which may overwhelm users. To deal with these issues, we propose to refine
spreadsheet smells by exploiting inferred structural information for smell
detection. We therefore first provide a detailed description of our static
analysis approach to infer clusters and blocks of related cells. We then
elaborate on how to improve existing smells by providing three example
refinements of existing smells that incorporate information about cell groups
and computation blocks. Furthermore, we propose three novel smell detection
techniques that make use of the inferred spreadsheet structures. Empirical
evaluation of the proposed techniques suggests that the refinements
successfully reduce the number of incorrectly and redundantly reported smells,
and novel deficits are revealed by the newly introduced smells.

Motivation: 解决电子表格在复杂性增加后难以理解和修改的问题，通过提供更高阶的心智模型来促进复杂系统的认知。

Method: 提出一种结构感知理解和交互的概念，该概念利用结构信息来丰富可视化、响应式地增强传统用户操作，并提供主动更改电子表格组成部分的工具。

Result: 实现了一个用于结构推断和可视化的工具，并计划在此框架基础上引入主动和响应式交互机制，最终将结构感知功能作为插件提供给常用的电子表格处理器。

Conclusion: 提供关于电子表格的结构感知功能，以提高用户生产力和电子表格质量。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are the go-to tool for computerized calculation and modelling,
but are hard to comprehend and adapt after reaching a certain complexity. In
general, cognition of complex systems is facilitated by having a higher order
mental model of the system in question to work with. We therefore present a
concept for structure-aware understanding of and interaction with spreadsheets
that extends previous work on structure inference in the domain. Following this
concept, structural information is used to enrich visualizations, reactively
enhance traditional user actions, and provide tools to proactively alter the
overall spreadsheet makeup instead of individual cells The intended systems
should, in first approximation, not replace common spreadsheet tools, but
provide an additional layer of functionality alongside the established
interface. In ongoing work, we therefore implemented a tool for structure
inference and visualization along the common spreadsheet layout. Based on this
framework, we plan to introduce the envisioned proactive and reactive
interaction mechanics, and finally provide structure-aware unctionality as an
add-in for common spreadsheet processors. We believe that providing the tools
for thinking about and interacting with spreadsheets in this manner will
benefit users both in terms of productivity and overall spreadsheet quality.

Conclusion:  该论文提出了一种基于行列类型转换的电子表格转换新方法，并探讨了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Spreadsheet tables are often labeled, and these labels effectively constitute
types for the data in the table. In such cases tables can be considered to be
built from typed data where the placement of values within the table is
controlled by the types used for rows and columns. We present a new approach to
the transformations of spreadsheet tables that is based on transformations of
row and column types. We illustrate the basic idea of type-based table
construction and transformation and lay out a series of research questions that
should be addressed in future work.

TL;DR: This paper creates spreadsheet formulas to automatically filter and sort data like SQL, which is better than Excel's manual tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide spreadsheet users with automatic data subsetting and ordering capabilities similar to SQL, overcoming the limitations of current spreadsheet tools that do not react to changes in calculated values.

Method: Developing spreadsheet formulas to implement SQL's WHERE and ORDER BY functionality.

Result: Spreadsheet formulas that replicate the functionality of SQL's WHERE and ORDER BY clauses, providing automatic updates in response to data changes.

Conclusion: The paper develops spreadsheet formulas that mimic SQL's WHERE and ORDER BY clauses, offering automatic updates unlike existing spreadsheet tools.

Abstract: The WHERE and ORDER BY clauses of the SQL SELECT statement select a subset of
rows in the result of a database query and present the result in the specified
order. In a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel, one could use the filter
and sort buttons, or use its Query or its Pivot Table tools to achieve a
similar effect. The disadvantage of using those tools is that they don't react
automatically to changes in the calculated values of the spreadsheet. In this
paper, we develop spreadsheet formulas that implement SQL's WHERE and ORDER BY
clauses.

Result: 这项研究分析了Enron和EUSES这两个电子表格语料库中图表，数据透视表和数组公式的用法，以期为改进电子表格质量提供见解。

Conclusion: 为了提高电子表格的质量，未来的研究应该包括对图表，数据透视表和数组公式等组件的分析。

Abstract: The use of spreadsheets in industry is widespread. Companies base decisions
on information coming from spreadsheets. Unfortunately, spreadsheets are
error-prone and this increases the risk that companies base their decisions on
inaccurate information, which can lead to incorrect decisions and loss of
money. In general, spreadsheet research is aimed to reduce the error-proneness
of spreadsheets. Most research is concentrated on the use of formulas. However,
there are other constructions in spreadsheets, like charts, pivot tables, and
array formulas, that are also used to present decision support information to
the user. There is almost no research about how these constructions are used.
To improve spreadsheet quality it is important to understand how spreadsheets
are used and to obtain a complete understanding, the use of charts, pivot
tables, and array formulas should be included in research. In this paper, we
analyze two popular spreadsheet corpora: Enron and EUSES on the use of the
aforementioned constructions.

### [185] [Asheetoxy: A Taxonomy for Classifying Negative Spreadsheet-related Phenomena](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10231)
*Daniel Kulesz,Stefan Wagner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 电子表格错误泛滥，现有分类法有缺陷。我们提出了Asheetoxy，一种更简单、更通用的分类法，并初步验证了其实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格错误是导致许多糟糕决策的原因，但现有分类法存在术语模糊、需要深入了解用户状态和底层流程等问题，导致无法对现有语料库中的现象进行分类。

Method: 提出了一种名为Asheetoxy的分类法，该方法避免使用“错误”一词，并且只需要对现象进行分类，而不需要了解底层流程或用户状态。

Result: 初步研究表明，即使是非电子表格研究人员，使用Asheetoxy也可以对现实世界中的电子表格现象进行分类。Participants=7

Conclusion: Asheetoxy是一种简单且面向现象的分类法，它完全避免了使用“错误”这个词。一项有7名参与者进行的初步研究表明，即使是非电子表格研究人员，使用Asheetoxy也可以对现实世界中的电子表格现象进行分类。

Abstract: Spreadsheets (sometimes also called Excel programs) are powerful tools which
play a business-critical role in many organizations. However, due to faulty
spreadsheets many bad decisions have been taken in recent years. Since then, a
number of researchers have been studying spreadsheet errors. However, one issue
that hinders discussion among researchers and professionals is the lack of a
commonly accepted taxonomy.
  Albeit a number of taxonomies for spreadsheet errors have been proposed in
previous work, a major issue is that they use the term error that itself is
already ambiguous. Furthermore, to apply most existing taxonomies, detailed
knowledge about the underlying process and knowledge about the "brain state" of
the acting spreadsheet users is required. Due to these limitations, known
error-like phenomena in freely available spreadsheet corpora cannot be
classified with these taxonomies.
  We propose Asheetoxy, a simple and phenomenon-oriented taxonomy that avoids
the problematic term error altogether. An initial study with 7 participants
indicates that even non-spreadsheet researchers similarly classify real-world
spreadsheet phenomena using Asheetoxy.

### [187] [Combining Spreadsheet Smells for Improved Fault Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10493)
*Patrick Koch,Konstantin Schekotihin,Dietmar Jannach,Birgit Hofer,Franz Wotawa*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Spreadsheet smells can predict faults, but combining them with AdaBoost improves accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited predictive power of individual spreadsheet smells for fault prediction.

Method: A machine learning based approach using an AdaBoost ensemble classifier to combine predictions of individual spreadsheet smells.

Result: Significant improvements in fault prediction accuracy compared to individual smells, as shown by experiments on two public datasets.

Conclusion: Adaboost ensemble classifier combines the predictions of individual smells, showing significant improvements in fault prediction accuracy on real-world spreadsheet faults.

Abstract: Spreadsheets are commonly used in organizations as a programming tool for
business-related calculations and decision making. Since faults in spreadsheets
can have severe business impacts, a number of approaches from general software
engineering have been applied to spreadsheets in recent years, among them the
concept of code smells. Smells can in particular be used for the task of fault
prediction. An analysis of existing spreadsheet smells, however, revealed that
the predictive power of individual smells can be limited. In this work we
therefore propose a machine learning based approach which combines the
predictions of individual smells by using an AdaBoost ensemble classifier.
Experiments on two public datasets containing real-world spreadsheet faults
show significant improvements in terms of fault prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: 一个方便的Web版电子表格编辑器，可将电子表格数据转换为RDF，用户可快速高效地创建语义数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决普通知识工作者在创建RDF语句方面面临的挑战，利用他们熟悉的电子表格作为工具来创建语义数据。

Method: 提出一个易于使用的、零配置的、基于Web的电子表格编辑器，能够同时将电子表格条目转换为RDF语句。

Result: 在用户研究中，参与者能够更快地创建更多语句，并且质量相当或显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个基于Web的电子表格编辑器，可以方便地将电子表格条目转换为RDF语句，使得各种用户都能轻松创建语义数据。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are widely used by knowledge workers, especially in the
industrial sector. Their methodology enables a well understood, easy and fast
possibility to enter data. As filling out a spreadsheet is more accessible to
common knowledge workers than defining RDF statements, in this paper, we
propose an easy-to-use, zero-configuration, web-based spreadsheet editor that
simultaneously transfers spreadsheet entries into RDF statements. It enables
various kinds of users to easily create semantic data whether they are RDF
experts or novices. The typical scenario we address focuses on creating
instance data starting with an empty knowledge base that is filled
incrementally. In a user study, participants were able to create more
statements in shorter time, having similar or even significantly outperforming
quality, compared to other approaches.

### [189] [Structured Spreadsheet Modelling and Implementation with Multiple Dimensions - Part 1: Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09777)
*Paul Mireault*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The abstract discusses the common use of the time dimension in models and the inefficient ways of representing a second dimension in spreadsheets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the limitations of representing multiple dimensions in everyday models, such as financial spreadsheets, which often rely on repeating formula blocks or multiple worksheets.

Method: The abstract does not describe a specific method.

Result: The abstract highlights the common practice of using time as a primary dimension and the inefficiency of current methods for incorporating a second dimension.

Conclusion: The abstract does not provide a conclusion.

Abstract: Dimensions are an integral part of many models we use every day. Without
thinking about it, we frequently use the time dimension: many financial and
accounting spreadsheets have columns representing months or years. Representing
a second dimension is often done by repeating blocs of formulas in a worksheet
or creating multiple worksheets with the same structure.

### [190] [Mitigating Spreadsheet Risk in Complex Multi-Dimensional Models in Excel](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01640)
*Steve Litt*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: PivotModel is a new solution for Excel to reduce risks associated with complex spreadsheets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel are widely used but are manually intensive and prone to error, leading to difficulties in controlling spreadsheet risk, especially for complex multi-dimensional models.

Method: The solution, named PivotModel, functions similarly to a PivotTable but is designed to leverage the robust capabilities of the Microsoft Excel platform.

Result: The PivotModel aims to provide enhanced functionality for complex applications requiring sophisticated algorithms, challenging hierarchies, and database write-back, as well as multi-dimensional capabilities like reporting, data input forms, and ad hoc analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed PivotModel solution aims to mitigate spreadsheet risk in complex multi-dimensional models within Microsoft Excel.

Abstract: Microsoft Excel is the most ubiquitous analytical tool ever built. Companies
around the world leverage it for its power, flexibility and ease of use.
However, spreadsheets are manually intensive and prone to error, making it
difficult for companies to control spreadsheet risk. The following solution is
designed to mitigate spreadsheet risk for a set of problems commonly addressed
in a spreadsheet defined as "complex multi-dimensional models". "Complex"
referring to certain types of applications that require functionality such as
sophisticated algorithms, challenging hierarchies and database write-back (i.e.
planning, forecasting, etc.) and "multi-dimensional" referring to providing
capabilities such as reporting, data input forms and ad hoc analysis on the
different attributes associated with the resulting model. The solution is
defined as a "PivotModel" because it works similarly to a PivotTable but is
designed to leverage the robust capabilities of the Microsoft Excel platform.

### [191] [Proposed Spreadsheet Transparency Definition and Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01628)
*Craig Hatmaker*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 审计师需要模型透明，但缺乏明确的定义和衡量标准。本研究提出了一个具体的透明度定义，并开发了自动化工具，以帮助审计师评估模型，并让建模人员能够客观地比较不同的建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 审计师要求财务模型透明，但缺乏明确的定义和可衡量的标准，导致无法确定模型的透明度，也无法客观比较不同的建模方法。

Method: 提出一个具体的、可衡量的透明度定义，以及相应的自动化工具，用于评估电子表格模型的透明度。

Result: 提供了一个明确的透明度定义，使审计师能够评估模型是否满足要求，并使建模人员能够客观地选择最适合其目标的建模方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个针对电子表格建模的透明度定义，该定义足够具体，可以创建度量和自动化工具，以便审计师能够确定模型是否满足透明度要求。该定义还使建模人员能够客观地比较电子表格建模方法，以选择最符合其目标的方法。

Abstract: Auditors demand financial models be transparent yet no consensus exists on
what that means precisely. Without a clear modeling transparency definition we
cannot know when our models are "transparent". The financial modeling community
debates which methods are more or less transparent as though transparency is a
quantifiable entity yet no measures exist. Without a transparency measure
modelers cannot objectively evaluate methods and know which improves model
transparency.
  This paper proposes a definition for spreadsheet modeling transparency that
is specific enough to create measures and automation tools for auditors to
determine if a model meets transparency requirements. The definition also
provides modelers the ability to objectively compare spreadsheet modeling
methods to select which best meets their goals.

### [192] [Alternative Spreadsheet Model Designs for an Operations Management Model Embedded in a Periodic Business Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00484)
*Thomas A. Grossman,Vijay Mehrotra,Mouwafac Sidaoui*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Three spreadsheet models for operations management were evaluated. A novel technical design allows for faster, error-free modifications and has broader potential, outperforming data-driven and canonical designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for model modification and reuse in periodic operations management business processes, specifically within supply and distribution planning.

Method: Evaluation of three spreadsheet implementations (data-driven, canonical, and technical) based on accuracy, modification, analysis, and transfer suitability, considering required training and technical sophistication.

Result: The data-driven design highlights poor spreadsheet practices. The technical design allows modification without manual formula editing, improving speed and reducing errors, and shows potential for other model classes.

Conclusion: The technical design offers advantages in modification speed and error reduction, with potential for broader model application.

Abstract: We present a widely-used operations management model used in supply and
distribution planning, that is typically embedded in a periodic business
process that necessitates model modification and reuse. We consider three
alternative spreadsheet implementations, a data-driven design, a canonical
(textbook) design, and a novel (table-driven) technical design. We evaluate
each regarding suitability for accuracy, modification, analysis, and transfer.
We consider the degree of training and technical sophistication required to
utilize each design. The data-driven design provides insight into poor
spreadsheet practices by na\"ive modelers. The technical design can be modified
for new data and new structural elements without manual writing or editing of
cell formulas, thus speeding modification and reducing risk of error. The
technical design has potential for use with other classes of models. We
identify opportunities for future research.

TL;DR: 为解决电子表格模型中由于缺乏传统软件工程工具和协议而导致的错误率较高的问题，本研究提出了使用 Python 和开源包来开发可重现的审计工具，以供电子表格建模专业人士使用，使利益相关者能够开发清晰的模型“Oracle”来测试和审计电子表格计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格模型被视为软件，但电子表格开发者并非软件工程师，这导致了错误率的增加。本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用 Python 编程语言和免费的、开源的软件包。

Result: 为电子表格建模专业人士开发可重现的审计工具，使利益相关者能够开发清晰定义的模型“Oracle”，并使用这些模型来测试和审计电子表格计算。

Conclusion: 通过使用 Python 语言和开源包，可以为电子表格建模专业人士开发可重现的审计工具，使利益相关者能够开发清晰定义的模型“Oracle”，并使用这些模型来测试和审计电子表格计算。

Abstract: Across an aggregation of EuSpRIG presentation papers, two maxims hold true:
spreadsheets models are akin to software, yet spreadsheet developers are not
software engineers. As such, the lack of traditional software engineering tools
and protocols invites a higher rate of error in the end result. This paper lays
ground work for spreadsheet modelling professionals to develop reproducible
audit tools using freely available, open source packages built with the Python
programming language, enabling stakeholders to develop clearly defined model
"oracles" with which to test and audit spreadsheet calculations against.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: lish是一种新的数据模型，它使用嵌套列表和模板来改进电子表格，使其能够处理更复杂的结构，同时保持易用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统电子表格中单元格缺乏对更大结构认识的问题，这种问题会阻碍理解并增加公式复制的风险。

Method: 提出了一种名为“lish”的新型数据模型，作为传统电子表格网格的替代方案。该模型将单元格组织成嵌套列表，并允许使用模板来定义重复结构。

Result: 通过一个小型演示应用程序展示了“lish”的运行情况，证明了其在捕捉更高结构的同时保持电子表格简洁性的潜力。

Conclusion: 单元格可以被组织成嵌套列表，并且用户可以有选择地使用模板来原型化重复的结构，这些模板元素可以与传统工作表边界中的单元格相提并论，但它们是工作表的proper成员，并且可以包含内部结构。

Abstract: A spreadsheet is remarkably flexible in representing various forms of
structured data, but the individual cells have no knowledge of the larger
structures of which they may form a part. This can hamper comprehension and
increase formula replication, increasing the risk of error on both scores. We
explore a novel data model (called the "lish") that could form an alternative
to the traditional grid in a spreadsheet-like environment. Its aim is to
capture some of these higher structures while preserving the simplicity that
makes a spreadsheet so attractive. It is based on cells organised into nested
lists, in each of which the user may optionally employ a template to prototype
repeating structures. These template elements can be likened to the marginal
"cells" in the borders of a traditional worksheet, but are proper members of
the sheet and may themselves contain internal structure. A small demonstration
application shows the "lish" in operation.

### [195] [Automated Refactoring of Nested-IF Formulae in Spreadsheets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09797)
*Jie Zhang,Shi Han,Dan Hao,Lu Zhang,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 自动化重构电子表格中的嵌套IF公式，提升代码质量和用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格是常用的端用户编程软件，但其公式（尤其是嵌套IF表达式）存在可读性差、认知成本高、易出错等问题，而终端用户通常缺乏必要的编程知识来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于抽象语法树（AST）的自动化方法，通过检测和移除逻辑冗余，并识别和重组高层语义（使用内置函数）来重构嵌套IF公式。

Result: 在包含2700万个嵌套IF公式的68000个真实世界电子表格上的评估显示，该方法能重构超过99%的嵌套IF公式，其中超过50%的重构将嵌套层级减少了一半以上。用户调查也表明，大多数用户偏好重构后的公式，并认为这种自动化方法是必要且有用的。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于AST的自动化方法来重构嵌套IF公式，实验结果表明该方法能有效提高可读性并降低维护成本，用户调查也显示了其有效性和必要性。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are the most popular end-user programming software, where
formulae act like programs and also have smells. One well recognized common
smell of spreadsheet formulae is nest-IF expressions, which have low
readability and high cognitive cost for users, and are error-prone during reuse
or maintenance. However, end users usually lack essential programming language
knowledge and skills to tackle or even realize the problem. The previous
research work has made very initial attempts in this aspect, while no effective
and automated approach is currently available.
  This paper firstly proposes an AST-based automated approach to systematically
refactoring nest-IF formulae. The general idea is two-fold. First, we detect
and remove logic redundancy on the AST. Second, we identify higher-level
semantics that have been fragmented and scattered, and reassemble the syntax
using concise built-in functions. A comprehensive evaluation has been conducted
against a real-world spreadsheet corpus, which is collected in a leading IT
company for research purpose. The results with over 68,000 spreadsheets with 27
million nest-IF formulae reveal that our approach is able to relieve the smell
of over 99\% of nest-IF formulae. Over 50% of the refactorings have reduced
nesting levels of the nest-IFs by more than a half. In addition, a survey
involving 49 participants indicates that for most cases the participants prefer
the refactored formulae, and agree on that such automated refactoring approach
is necessary and helpful.

### [196] [Spreadsheet Guardian: An Approach to Protecting Semantic Correctness throughout the Evolution of Spreadsheets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03813)
*Daniel Kulesz,Verena Käfer,Stefan Wagner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Spreadsheet Guardian is an approach that separates test rule specification from execution to detect semantic faults and prevent errors during collaborative spreadsheet maintenance. Evaluations show it's user-friendly and improves users' perception of correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spreadsheets play a business-critical role but are prone to errors, and there is a lack of support for ensuring their correctness during collaborative maintenance.

Method: Spreadsheet Guardian separates the specification of spreadsheet test rules from their execution. By automatically executing user-defined test rules, it detects semantic faults and protects users from introducing faults during maintenance.

Result: The technique is easy to learn and apply. Participants using Spreadsheet Guardian are more realistic about their spreadsheet correctness after maintenance compared to those using traditional methods.

Conclusion: Spreadsheet Guardian can be of use for business-critical spreadsheets.

Abstract: Spreadsheets are powerful tools which play a business-critical role in many
organizations. However, many bad decisions taken due to faulty spreadsheets
show that these tools need serious quality assurance. Furthermore, while
collaboration on spreadsheets for maintenance tasks is common, there has been
almost no support for ensuring that the spreadsheets remain correct during this
process.
  We have developed an approach named Spreadsheet Guardian which separates the
specification of spreadsheet test rules from their execution. By automatically
executing user-defined test rules, our approach is able to detect semantic
faults. It also protects all collaborating spreadsheet users from introducing
faults during maintenance, even if only few end-users specify test rules. To
evaluate Spreadsheet Guardian, we implemented a representative testing
technique as an add-in for Microsoft Excel.
  We evaluated the testing technique in two empirical evaluations with 29
end-users and 42 computer science students. The results indicate that the
technique is easy to learn and to apply. Furthermore, after finishing
maintenance, participants with spreadsheets "protected" by the technique are
more realistic about the correctness of their spreadsheets than participants
who employ only "classic", non-interactive test rules based on static analysis
techniques. Hence, we believe Spreadsheet Guardian can be of use for
business-critical spreadsheets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了实现有效的、针对特定背景的RE风险管理，需要了解更多关于特定背景的RE现象的经验知识。

Method: 使用来自228家公司的调查数据，构建了一个支持特定背景的RE现象预测的概率网络。该方法论通过电子表格实现，以支持轻量级的风险评估。

Result: 所提出的方法论增加了对RE中各个风险因素的认识，并为推广到实践中提供了反馈。

Conclusion: 该方法论通过在6家公司进行的初步验证，增强了对RE中各个风险因素的认识，并且反馈允许将该方法论推广到实践中。

Abstract: Background: The sensitivity of Requirements Engineering (RE) to the context
makes it difficult to efficiently control problems therein, thus, hampering an
effective risk management devoted to allow for early corrective or even
preventive measures. Problem: There is still little empirical knowledge about
context-specific RE phenomena which would be necessary for an effective
context- sensitive risk management in RE. Goal: We propose and validate an
evidence-based approach to assess risks in RE using cross-company data about
problems, causes and effects. Research Method: We use survey data from 228
companies and build a probabilistic network that supports the forecast of
context-specific RE phenomena. We implement this approach using spreadsheets to
support a light-weight risk assessment. Results: Our results from an initial
validation in 6 companies strengthen our confidence that the approach increases
the awareness for individual risk factors in RE, and the feedback further
allows for disseminating our approach into practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格虽然灵活易用，但容易出错。现有的模型语言在表达能力上存在局限，无法充分描述真实电子表格中的各种特性。

Method: 提出了一种名为 Tabula 的新建模语言，用于电子表格的开发，以解决现有模型表达能力有限的问题。

Result: Tabula 语言比其他模型更具表达力，并且可以扩展更多功能，还包含一个双向转换引擎，可以确保在模型或电子表格更新后保持同步。

Conclusion: Tabula 语言通过增加类型约束和嵌套类重复等特性，扩展了电子表格模型，提高了表达能力，并能通过双向转换引擎保证模型和电子表格之间同步。

Abstract: Spreadsheets provide a flexible and easy to use software development
environment, but that leads to error proneness. Work has been done to prevent
errors in spreadsheets, including using models to specify distinct parts of a
spreadsheet as it is done with model-driven software development. Previous
model languages for spreadsheets offer a limited expressiveness, and cannot
model several features present in most real world spreadsheets.
  In this paper, the modeling language Tabula is introduced. It extends
previous spreadsheet models with features like type constraints and nested
classes with repetitions. Tabula is not only more expressive than other models
but it can also be extended with more features. Moreover, Tabula includes a
bidirectional transformation engine that guarantees synchronization after an
update either in the model or spreadsheet.

*Liang Xu,Wensheng Dou,Chushu Gao,Jie Wang,Jun Wei,Hua Zhong,Tao Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SpreadCluster的算法，通过分析电子表格的共同特征来聚类不同版本，解决了现有方法在版本信息缺失情况下的局限性，并在多个数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端用户很少使用版本控制工具来记录电子表格的版本信息，导致电子表格版本信息缺失，不同版本的电子表格以单个相似电子表格的形式共存。现有方法通过聚类相似电子表格来恢复版本信息，但由于文件名和邮件对话等必要信息的缺失，其适用性和准确性有限。

Method: 提出了一种名为SpreadCluster的自动聚类算法，该算法通过学习版本电子表格中的共同特征（如相似的表格标题和工作表名称）来聚类电子表格，并将具有相似特征的电子表格自动聚类到同一个进化组中。

Result: SpreadCluster在Enron语料库上的评估结果显示，其聚类精度和召回率均高于基于文件名的模糊聚类方法。SpreadCluster在FUSE和EUSES两个语料库上也实现了高精度的聚类。

Conclusion: SpreadCluster可以通过学习版本电子表格中的特征标准，将具有相似特征的电子表格自动聚类到同一进化组中。结果表明，SpreadCluster比VEnron中使用的基于文件名的模糊聚类方法具有更高的准确率和召回率。此外，基于SpreadCluster的聚类结果，创建了一个比VEnron更大的新版本电子表格语料库VEnron2。SpreadCluster在FUSE和EUSES两个电子表格语料库上也表现出了高准确率。

Abstract: Version information plays an important role in spreadsheet understanding,
maintaining and quality improving. However, end users rarely use version
control tools to document spreadsheet version information. Thus, the
spreadsheet version information is missing, and different versions of a
spreadsheet coexist as individual and similar spreadsheets. Existing approaches
try to recover spreadsheet version information through clustering these similar
spreadsheets based on spreadsheet filenames or related email conversation.
However, the applicability and accuracy of existing clustering approaches are
limited due to the necessary information (e.g., filenames and email
conversation) is usually missing. We inspected the versioned spreadsheets in
VEnron, which is extracted from the Enron Corporation. In VEnron, the different
versions of a spreadsheet are clustered into an evolution group. We observed
that the versioned spreadsheets in each evolution group exhibit certain common
features (e.g., similar table headers and worksheet names). Based on this
observation, we proposed an automatic clustering algorithm, SpreadCluster.
SpreadCluster learns the criteria of features from the versioned spreadsheets
in VEnron, and then automatically clusters spreadsheets with the similar
features into the same evolution group. We applied SpreadCluster on all
spreadsheets in the Enron corpus. The evaluation result shows that
SpreadCluster could cluster spreadsheets with higher precision and recall rate
than the filename-based approach used by VEnron. Based on the clustering result
by SpreadCluster, we further created a new versioned spreadsheet corpus
VEnron2, which is much bigger than VEnron. We also applied SpreadCluster on the
other two spreadsheet corpora FUSE and EUSES. The results show that
SpreadCluster can cluster the versioned spreadsheets in these two corpora with
high precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格在工业界广泛使用，即使在关键业务流程中也是如此。因此，有必要对电子表格进行适当的风险评估，以评估其结果的可靠性和有效性。然而，直到目前，对于影响电子表格复杂性的驱动因素还没有统一的认识。

Method: 提出一个整合了所有被认为可能影响电子表格复杂性的因素的 개념模型。

Result: 该模型整合了相关文献中已识别出的所有潜在的电子表格复杂性驱动因素，解决了这一研究空白。

Conclusion: 该模型为结构化复杂性指标的定义奠定了基础，从而提高了结果的可重复性。该模型也为从其他科学领域识别更多适用的复杂性指标奠定了基础。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are widely used in industry, even for critical business
processes. This implies the need for proper risk assessment in spreadsheets to
evaluate the reliability and validity of the spreadsheet's outcome. As related
research has shown, the risk of spreadsheet errors is strongly related to the
spreadsheet's complexity. Therefore, spreadsheet researchers proposed various
metrics for quantifying different aspects of a spreadsheet in order to assess
its complexity. However, until now there is no shared understanding of
potential complexity drivers for spreadsheets. The present work addresses this
research gap by proposing a conceptual model integrating all aspects which are
identified by related literature as potential drivers to spreadsheet
complexity. In this sense, this model forms the foundation for a structured
definition of complexity metrics, and thus enhances the reproducibility of
their results. At the same time, it forms the foundation for identifying
further applicable complexity metrics from other scientific domains.
