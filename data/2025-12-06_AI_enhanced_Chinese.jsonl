Although LLMs have shown remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks, evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model progress in this important area.\n  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 28K questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills -- including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI GPT-5 and DeepSeek R1 score only around 69\\% and 57\\% respectively, suggesting significant room for improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing foundation models for structured data processing and analysis.\n  Our code and data are available at https://github.com/MMTU-Benchmark/MMTU and https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMTU-benchmark/MMTU.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMTU is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on real-world table tasks.", "motivation": "Existing benchmarks for table-related tasks are limited and do not cover the full range of tasks faced by professional users.", "method": "Introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 28K questions across 25 real-world table tasks.", "result": "Current frontier models struggle on MMTU, suggesting significant room for improvement.", "conclusion": "MMTU can drive further advances in understanding and developing foundation models for structured data processing and analysis."}}

Previous studies have developed methods to advance these challenges through the application of deep neural networks in tandem with automated cameras; however, the datasets being studied often excluded physical labels. In this study, we used a dataset provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory with 1,672 images of Populus Trichocarpa with white labels displaying treatment (control or drought), block, row, position, and genotype. Optical character recognition (OCR) was used to read these labels on the plants, image segmentation techniques in conjunction with machine learning algorithms were used for morphological classifications, machine learning models were used to predict treatment based on those classifications, and analyzed encoded EXIF tags were used for the purpose of finding leaf size and correlations between phenotypes. We found that our OCR model had an accuracy of 94.31% for non-null text extractions, allowing for the information to be accurately placed in a spreadsheet. Our classification models identified leaf shape, color, and level of brown splotches with an average accuracy of 62.82%, and plant treatment with an accuracy of 60.08%.

First, we create a dataset of real-world NL-to-code tasks manipulating tabular data, mined from StackOverflow posts. Second, we introduce a cluster-then-select prompting technique, which adds the most representative rows from the input data to the LLM prompt. Our experiments show that LLM performance is indeed sensitive to the amount of data passed in the prompt, and that for tasks with a lot of syntactic variation in the input table, our cluster-then-select technique outperforms a random selection baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u5305\u542b\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u6237\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u96be\u4ee5\u8868\u8fbe\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eceStackOverflow\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u7684\u771f\u5b9eNL-to-code\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u30022. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b-\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u884c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230LLM\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u786e\u5b9e\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u5177\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u53e5\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8be5\u805a\u7c7b-\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728LLM\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u805a\u7c7b-\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
