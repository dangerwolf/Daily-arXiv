Abstract: Tables have gained significant attention in large language models (LLMs) and
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to their complex and flexible
structure. Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing
formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex,
multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in
format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks,
instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks
challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts
through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction of
table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that
indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of
retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and
logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing
complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table
scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different
tabular representations and formats.

### [2] [A Conditional GAN for Tabular Data Generation with Probabilistic Sampling of Latent Subspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00472)
*Leonidas Akritidis,Panayiotis Bozanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ctdGAN是一种用于解决表格数据类别不平衡问题的条件生成对抗网络，通过空间划分、概率采样和改进的损失函数来生成更优的合成数据，并在实验中表现出优越性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GAN模型在处理表格数据时，未能考虑到输入样本的向量子空间，导致生成的数据位置随意，并且类别标签的处理方式与其他分类变量相同，使得条件采样效果不佳。

Method: ctdGAN首先执行空间划分步骤为输入样本分配聚类标签，然后利用这些标签通过新颖的概率采样策略和惩罚聚类及类别错误预测的新损失函数来合成样本。此外，还引入了通过聚类进行区分的缩放技术。

Result: ctdGAN能够生成高保真样本并提高分类准确性。

Conclusion: ctdGAN在14个不平衡数据集上的详尽评估证明了其在生成高保真样本和提高分类准确性方面的优越性。

Abstract: The tabular form constitutes the standard way of representing data in
relational database systems and spreadsheets. But, similarly to other forms,
tabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious
performance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the
most effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the
under-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed
GAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the
real data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover,
the class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical
variables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less
effective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a
conditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially,
ctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input
samples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a
novel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes
both cluster and class mis-predictions. In this way, ctdGAN is trained to
generate samples in subspaces that resemble those of the original data
distribution. We also introduce several other improvements, including a simple,
yet effective cluster-wise scaling technique that captures multiple feature
modes without affecting data dimensionality. The exhaustive evaluation of
ctdGAN with 14 imbalanced datasets demonstrated its superiority in generating
high fidelity samples and improving classification accuracy.
