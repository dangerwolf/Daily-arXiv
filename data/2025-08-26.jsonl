In this paper we present TaFo, a neuro-symbolic approach to\ngenerating CF suggestions for tables, addressing common challenges such as user\nunawareness, difficulty in rule creation, and inadequate user interfaces. TaFo\ntakes inspiration from component based synthesis systems and extends them with\nsemantic knowledge of language models and a diversity preserving rule\nranking.Unlike previous methods focused on structural formatting, TaFo uniquely\nincorporates value-based formatting, automatically learning both the rule\ntrigger and the associated visual formatting properties for CF rules. By\nremoving the dependency on user specification used by existing techniques in\nthe form of formatted examples or natural language instruction, TaFo makes\nformatting completely predictive and automated for the user. To evaluate TaFo,\nwe use a corpus of 1.8 Million public workbooks with CF and manual formatting.\nWe compare TaFo against a diverse set of symbolic and neural systems designed\nfor or adapted for the task of table formatting. Our results show that TaFo\ngenerates more accurate, diverse and complete formatting suggestions than\ncurrent systems and outperforms these by 15.6\\%--26.5\\% on matching user added\nground truth rules in tables."}
