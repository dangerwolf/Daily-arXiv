For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604 tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08Toolathlon\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8632\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c604\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7406\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u8de8\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Toolathlon\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b32\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c604\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5305\u62ec108\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9700\u898120\u4e2a\u56de\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u811a\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728Toolathlon\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Claude-4.5-Sonnet\uff09\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a38.6%\uff0c\u800c\u9876\u5c16\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp\uff09\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a20.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "Toolathlon\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u3001\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) offer promising assistance by explaining formula errors, the automated correction of these semantic runtime errors remains an open problem. A primary challenge to advancing models for such scenarios is the severe lack of high-quality, comprehensive datasets for training and rigorous evaluation. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel approach for constructing a benchmark dataset specifically designed for Excel formula repair. We propose a data generation pipeline, which leverages a small set of curated seed samples from online forums to synthetically expand the dataset. Our pipeline integrates few-shot prompting with LLMs and employs a robust \\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge} validation framework, combined with execution-based checks to ensure the correctness and semantic fidelity of the generated data. This process produced a benchmark dataset of 618 high-quality samples, covering common runtime errors. Furthermore, we propose a context-aware baseline technique for Excel formula repair that utilizes LLMs to leverage both the faulty formula, and relevant spreadsheet context. We evaluate the performance of various LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Phi-3, Mistral) on our newly generated benchmark using execution-based metrics. Our analysis demonstrates the dataset's quality through manual annotation and provides insights into error and function distributions. The proposed generation methodology is highly scalable and can be readily adapted to create evaluation benchmarks for similar code repair tasks in other low-resource programming languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b618\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684Excel\u516c\u5f0f\u4fee\u590d\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u516c\u5f0f\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cdLLM\u5728\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "Excel\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u516c\u5f0f\u65f6\u5bf9\u65b0\u624b\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u53cb\u597d\uff0c\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u4ecd\u662f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u8bba\u575b\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08few-shot prompting\uff09\u548cLLM-as-a-Judge\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u6765\u5408\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1Excel\u516c\u5f0f\u4fee\u590d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528LLM\u7ed3\u5408\u9519\u8bef\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b618\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6267\u884c\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GPT-4o\u3001GPT-4.1\u3001Phi-3\u548cMistral\u7b49LLM\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u9519\u8bef/\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aExcel\u516c\u5f0f\u4fee\u590d\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u501f\u9274\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LLM\u5728Excel\u516c\u5f0f\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
