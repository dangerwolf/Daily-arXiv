Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete, grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics, such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes and data is available at Github.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成代码和电子表格逻辑时常出现幻觉、逻辑不一致和语法错误，尤其是在金融建模和科学计算等高风险领域，这带来了严重的准确性和可靠性问题。

Method: 本文提出了一个结构化研究框架，将测试驱动开发（TDD）与LLM驱动的生成相结合。该框架采用“测试优先”的方法，旨在通过提供技术约束和认知支架，引导LLM生成更准确、可验证和可理解的解决方案。它适用于多种编程环境，并包含明确的实验设计、评估指标和TDD提示示例。

Result: 本文提出了一种框架，并假设“测试优先”的方法能使LLM输出更准确、可验证和可理解。旨在提高计算思维、提示工程技能和用户参与度，特别是对于缺乏正式编程训练但易受逻辑错误影响的电子表格用户。

Conclusion: 本文邀请合作以完善和实证评估此方法，最终目标是在教育和专业开发实践中建立负责任和可靠的LLM集成。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate, verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking, prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development practices.
