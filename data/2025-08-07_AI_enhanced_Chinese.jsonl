The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes\nbut of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and\nrelations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or\ndescription of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and\npixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text\nand images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most\nvaluable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These\nare not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are\nfull of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other\nidentifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that\nstudies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,\nstatistical relational AI, and many others.

In\na spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data\nby computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However,\nidentifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables\nremains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the\nproblem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot\ntables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of\nrecommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works\ninadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to\nconsider the problem of pivot table diversification.\n  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted\ndiverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k\nrecommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is\ninsightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences,\nwhile also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each\nother, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical\ncontributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a\nsingle pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a\nscalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot\ntables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce\nthe combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently\nscales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets.

To explore this, we conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with\nprofessional spreadsheet users from two separate samples. We found that\nspreadsheet providers face challenges in adapting highly personalised\nstrategies to often subjective standards and evaluating the appropriate social\ntiming of sharing. In addition, conflicted self-evaluations of one's\nspreadsheet expertise, dismissive normative beliefs about the value of this\nknowledge, and concerns about the potential disruptions associated with\ncollaboration can further deter sharing. We suggest these observations reflect\nthe challenges of long-term learning in feature-rich software designed\nprimarily with initial learnability in mind.

Although LLMs have shown\nremarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database\ncopilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains\nlimited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks,\nevaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like\nNL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks\nthat professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model\nprogress in this important area.\n  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K\nquestions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively\nevaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at\nthe expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science\nresearch on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by\nprofessional users.

We describe in\ndetail a deidentification workflow for DICOM data using facilities in XNAT,\ntogether with independent tools in the XNAT \"ecosystem\". We list different\ncontexts in which deidentification might be needed, based on our prior\nexperience. The starting point for participation in the Medical Image\nDe-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B) challenge was a set of pre-existing local\nmethodologies, which were adapted during the validation phase of the challenge.\nOur result in the test phase was 97.91\\%, considerably lower than our peers,\ndue largely to an arcane technical incompatibility of our methodology with the\nchallenge's Synapse platform, which prevented us receiving feedback during the\nvalidation phase. Post-submission, additional discrepancy reports from the\norganisers and via the MIDI-B Continuous Benchmarking facility, enabled us to\nimprove this score significantly to 99.61\\%. An entirely rule-based approach\nwas shown to be capable of removing all name-related information in the test\ncorpus, but exhibited failures in dealing fully with address data. Initial\nexperiments using published machine-learning models to remove addresses were\npartially successful but showed the models to be \"over-aggressive\" on other\ntypes of free-text data, leading to a slight overall degradation in performance\nto 99.54\\%. Future development will therefore focus on improving\naddress-recognition capabilities, but also on better removal of identifiable\ndata burned into the image pixels. Several technical aspects relating to the\n\"answer key\" are still under discussion with the challenge organisers, but we\nestimate that our percentage of genuine deidentification failures on the MIDI-B\ntest corpus currently stands at 0.19\\%.

We construct our\nRepository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured\nclassifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our\ntaxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level\nCausal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1)\nEntity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3)\nTiming: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI\nRisks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination &\ntoxicity, (2) Privacy & security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors &\nmisuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic & environmental, and\n(7) AI system safety, failures, & limitations.

The project is defined by three central characteristics:\nit is a reference corpus, a historical corpus, and a syntactically deeply\nannotated treebank. As a historical corpus, GiesKaNe aims to establish\nconnections with both historical and contemporary corpora, ensuring its\nrelevance across temporal and linguistic contexts. The compilation process\nstrikes the balance between innovation and adherence to standards, addressing\nboth internal project goals and the broader interests of the research\ncommunity. The methodological complexity of such a project is managed through a\ncomplementary interplay of human expertise and machine-assisted processes. The\narticle discusses foundational topics such as tokenization, normalization,\nsentence definition, tagging, parsing, and inter-annotator agreement, alongside\nadvanced considerations. These include comparisons between grammatical models,\nannotation schemas, and established de facto annotation standards as well as\nthe integration of human and machine collaboration. Notably, a novel method for\nmachine-assisted classification of texts along the continuum of conceptual\norality and literacy is proposed, offering new perspectives on text selection.\nFurthermore, the article introduces an approach to deriving de facto standard\nannotations from existing ones, mediating between standardization and\ninnovation.

Despite recent advances in\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) for various image understanding tasks, accurately\nidentifying and extracting the structures and relationships depicted in\ndiagrams continues to pose significant challenges. This study addresses these\nchallenges by proposing a text-driven approach that bypasses reliance on VLMs'\nvisual recognition capabilities. Instead, it utilizes the editable source\nfiles--such as xlsx, pptx or docx--where diagram elements (e.g., shapes, lines,\nannotations) are preserved as textual metadata. In our proof-of-concept, we\nextracted diagram information from xlsx-based system design documents and\ntransformed the extracted shape data into textual input for Large Language\nModels (LLMs). This approach allowed the LLM to analyze relationships and\ngenerate responses to business-oriented questions without the bottleneck of\nimage-based processing. Experimental comparisons with a VLM-based method\ndemonstrated that the proposed text-driven framework yielded more accurate\nanswers for questions requiring detailed comprehension of diagram\nstructures.The results obtained in this study are not limited to the tested\n.xlsx files but can also be extended to diagrams in other documents with source\nfiles, such as Office pptx and docx formats. These findings highlight the\nfeasibility of circumventing VLM constraints through direct textual extraction\nfrom original source files. By enabling robust diagram understanding through\nLLMs, our method offers a promising path toward enhanced workflow efficiency\nand information analysis in real-world business scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unexpected Error", "motivation": "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'model_dump'", "method": "N/A", "result": "N/A", "conclusion": "N/A"}}

However, tables and user questions in\nreal-world applications are more complex and diverse, presenting an unignorable\ngap compared to the existing benchmarks. To fill the gap, we propose a\n\\textbf{M}ult\\textbf{i}-scale spreadsheet benchmark with \\textbf{M}eta\n\\textbf{o}perations for \\textbf{Table} reasoning, named as MiMoTable.\nSpecifically, MiMoTable incorporates two key features. First, the tables in\nMiMoTable are all spreadsheets used in real-world scenarios, which cover seven\ndomains and contain different types.

Prompt middleware aims to\naddress this barrier by assisting in prompt construction, but barriers remain\nfor users in expressing adequate control so that they can receive AI-responses\nthat match their preferences.\n  We conduct a formative survey (n=38) investigating user needs for control\nover AI-generated explanations in comprehension tasks, which uncovers a\ntrade-off between standardized but predictable support for prompting, and\nadaptive but unpredictable support tailored to the user and task. To explore\nthis trade-off, we implement two prompt middleware approaches: Dynamic Prompt\nRefinement Control (Dynamic PRC) and Static Prompt Refinement Control (Static\nPRC). The Dynamic PRC approach generates context-specific UI elements that\nprovide prompt refinements based on the user's prompt and user needs from the\nAI, while the Static PRC approach offers a preset list of generally applicable\nrefinements.\n  We evaluate these two approaches with a controlled user study (n=16) to\nassess the impact of these approaches on user control of AI responses for\ncrafting better explanations. Results show a preference for the Dynamic PRC\napproach as it afforded more control, lowered barriers to providing context,\nand encouraged exploration and reflection of the tasks, but that reasoning\nabout the effects of different generated controls on the final output remains\nchallenging. Drawing on participant feedback, we discuss design implications\nfor future Dynamic PRC systems that enhance user control of AI responses.

However, while\nrecent foundation models have reduced the need for developing task-specific\ndatasets and predictors in domains such as language modeling and computer\nvision, this transfer learning paradigm has not had similar impact in the\ntabular domain. In this work, we seek to narrow this gap and present TabuLa-8B,\na language model for tabular prediction. We define a process for extracting a\nlarge, high-quality training dataset from the TabLib corpus, proposing methods\nfor tabular data filtering and quality control. Using the resulting dataset,\nwhich comprises over 2.1B rows from over 4M unique tables, we fine-tune a Llama\n3-8B large language model (LLM) for tabular data prediction (classification and\nbinned regression) using a novel packing and attention scheme for tabular\nprediction. Through evaluation across a test suite of 329 datasets, we find\nthat TabuLa-8B has zero-shot accuracy on unseen tables that is over 15\npercentage points (pp) higher than random guessing, a feat that is not possible\nwith existing state-of-the-art tabular prediction models (e.g. XGBoost,\nTabPFN). In the few-shot setting (1-32 shots), without any fine-tuning on the\ntarget datasets, TabuLa-8B is 5-15 pp more accurate than XGBoost and TabPFN\nmodels that are explicitly trained on equal, or even up to 16x more data.

Our comprehensive\nevaluation of various LLMs under both single-round and multi-round inference\nsettings reveals a substantial gap between the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models\nand human performance, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSpreadsheetBench\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u6765\u81ea\u771f\u5b9eExcel\u8bba\u575b\u95ee\u9898\u7684912\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b58\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f25\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u64cd\u4f5c\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSpreadsheetBench\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u5305\u542b912\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u5728Excel\u8bba\u575b\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e4b\u5339\u914d\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u8868\u683c\u3001\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u548c\u975e\u6587\u672c\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u5224\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6587\u4ef6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u503c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5404\u79cdLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406SpreadsheetBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u8fdc\u4e0d\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose three self-supervised challenges with corresponding\nevaluation metrics to comprehensively evaluate VLMs on Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR), spatial perception, and visual format recognition.\nAdditionally, we utilize the spreadsheet table detection task to assess the\noverall performance of VLMs by integrating these challenges. To probe VLMs more\nfinely, we propose three spreadsheet-to-image settings: column width\nadjustment, style change, and address augmentation.

In recent years, it has been coupled with\nmachine learning in order to improve the process of phenotyping plants by\nincreasing efficiency in handling large datasets and developing methods for the\nextraction of specific traits. Previous studies have developed methods to\nadvance these challenges through the application of deep neural networks in\ntandem with automated cameras; however, the datasets being studied often\nexcluded physical labels. In this study, we used a dataset provided by Oak\nRidge National Laboratory with 1,672 images of Populus Trichocarpa with white\nlabels displaying treatment (control or drought), block, row, position, and\ngenotype. Optical character recognition (OCR) was used to read these labels on\nthe plants, image segmentation techniques in conjunction with machine learning\nalgorithms were used for morphological classifications, machine learning models\nwere used to predict treatment based on those classifications, and analyzed\nencoded EXIF tags were used for the purpose of finding leaf size and\ncorrelations between phenotypes. We found that our OCR model had an accuracy of\n94.31% for non-null text extractions, allowing for the information to be\naccurately placed in a spreadsheet. Our classification models identified leaf\nshape, color, and level of brown splotches with an average accuracy of 62.82%,\nand plant treatment with an accuracy of 60.08%. Finally, we identified a few\ncrucial pieces of information absent from the EXIF tags that prevented the\nassessment of the leaf size. There was also missing information that prevented\nthe assessment of correlations between phenotypes and conditions. However,\nfuture studies could improve upon this to allow for the assessment of these\nfeatures.", "AI": {"tldr":

Today, spreadsheets are used by billions of users to\nmanipulate tables, most of whom are neither database experts nor professional\nprogrammers.\n  Despite the success of spreadsheets, authoring complex formulas remains\nchallenging, as non-technical users need to look up and understand non-trivial\nformula syntax. To address this pain point, we leverage the observation that\nthere is often an abundance of similar-looking spreadsheets in the same\norganization, which not only have similar data, but also share similar\ncomputation logic encoded as formulas. We develop an Auto-Formula system that\ncan accurately predict formulas that users want to author in a target\nspreadsheet cell, by learning and adapting formulas that already exist in\nsimilar spreadsheets, using contrastive-learning techniques inspired by\n\"similar-face recognition\" from compute vision.\n  Extensive evaluations on over 2K test formulas extracted from real enterprise\nspreadsheets show the effectiveness of Auto-Formula over alternatives.

For example, a\nhuman can produce a much greater, and more accurate, volume of mathematical\ncalculation in a unit of time using a calculator or a spreadsheet application\non a computer. Such tools have taken over the burden of lower level cognitive\ngrunt work but the human still serves the role of the expert performing higher\nlevel thinking and reasoning. Recently, however, unsupervised, deep, machine\nlearning has produced cognitive systems able to outperform humans in several\ndomains. When humans use these tools in a human cog ensemble, the cognitive\nability of the human is augmented. In some cases, even non experts can achieve,\nand even exceed, the performance of experts in a particular domain, synthetic\nexpertise. A new cognitive system, ChatGPT, has burst onto the scene during the\npast year. This paper investigates human cognitive augmentation due to using\nChatGPT by presenting the results of two experiments comparing responses\ncreated using ChatGPT with results created not using ChatGPT.

We demonstrate how this approach is\nbeing deployed in a biomedical consortium to define and collect metadata about\nscientific experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e00\u9879\u65b0\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u53d7\u63a7\u672f\u8bed\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f Web \u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u9996\u9009\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5b58\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u9661\u5ced\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u51e0\u9879\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u4e3a\u5728\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u677f\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u672f\u8bed\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f Web \u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u96c6\u6210\u53d7\u63a7\u672f\u8bed\u652f\u6301\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f Web \u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u8054\u76df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u9996\u9009\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5df2\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u5404\u79cd\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5b58\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u9661\u5ced\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u51e0\u9879\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u4e3a\u5728\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u677f\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u672f\u8bed\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f Web \u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u8054\u76df\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u6536\u96c6\u6709\u5173\u79d1\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

Spreadsheet software allows users to automatically\nformat their tables by writing data-dependent conditional formatting (CF)\nrules. Writing such rules is often challenging for users as it requires them to\nunderstand and implement the underlying logic. We present FormaT5, a\ntransformer-based model that can generate a CF rule given the target table and\na natural language description of the desired formatting logic. We find that\nuser descriptions for these tasks are often under-specified or ambiguous,\nmaking it harder for code generation systems to accurately learn the desired\nrule in a single step. To tackle this problem of under-specification and\nminimise argument errors, FormaT5 learns to predict placeholders though an\nabstention objective. These placeholders can then be filled by a second model\nor, when examples of rows that should be formatted are available, by a\nprogramming-by-example system.

A) Every day, about 0.2-0.5% of\nplayers solve the puzzle in one attempt. Because the odds of guessing the one\nof 2,315 possible target words at random is 0.043%, this implies that 4,000 -\n10,000 players cheat by obtaining the target word outside of playing the game!\nB) At least 1/3 of the players have a favorite starting word, or cycle through\nseveral.

Existing\ndeep learning methods for question answering on tabular data have various\nlimitations, such as having to feed the entire table as input into a neural\nnetwork model, making them unsuitable for most real-world applications. Since\nreal-world data might contain millions of rows, it may not entirely fit into\nthe memory. Moreover, data could be stored in live databases, which are updated\nin real-time, and it is impractical to serialize an entire database to a neural\nnetwork-friendly format each time it is updated. In TableQuery, we use deep\nlearning models pre-trained for question answering on free text to convert\nnatural language queries to structured queries, which can be run against a\ndatabase or a spreadsheet. This method eliminates the need for fitting the\nentire data into memory as well as serializing databases. Furthermore, deep\nlearning models pre-trained for question answering on free text are readily\navailable on platforms such as HuggingFace Model Hub (7).

Among other\nthings, our results indicate that 1) the wide field of view afforded by VR\nresults in significantly faster target slide identification times compared to a\ntablet-only interface for visually salient targets; and 2) the\nthree-dimensional view in VR enables significantly faster object reordering in\nthe presence of occlusion compared to two baseline interfaces.

Their widespread employment makes it\neasy to gather large collections of data, but their flexible canvas-based\nstructure makes automated analysis difficult without heavy preparation. One of\nthe common problems that practitioners face is the presence of multiple,\nindependent regions in a single spreadsheet, possibly separated by repeated\nempty cells. We define such files as \"multiregion\" files. In collections of\nvarious spreadsheets, we can observe that some share the same layout. We\npresent the Mondrian approach to automatically identify layout templates across\nmultiple files and systematically extract the corresponding regions. Our\napproach is composed of three phases: first, each file is rendered as an image\nand inspected for elements that could form regions; then, using a clustering\nalgorithm, the identified elements are grouped to form regions; finally, every\nfile layout is represented as a graph and compared with others to find layout\ntemplates. We compare our method to state-of-the-art table recognition\nalgorithms on two corpora of real-world enterprise spreadsheets. Our approach\nshows the best performances in detecting reliable region boundaries within each\nfile and can correctly identify recurring layouts across files.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mondrian\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u590d\u5e03\u5c40\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u753b\u5e03\u7ed3\u6784\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5355\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u7a7a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u5206\u9694\u3002", "method": "Mondrian\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1. \u5c06\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6e32\u67d3\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u53ef\u80fd\u5f62\u6210\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u5df2\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5206\u7ec4\u5f62\u6210\u533a\u57df\uff1b3. \u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u5e03\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u56fe\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ee5\u67e5\u627e\u5e03\u5c40\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8868\u683c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMondrian\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Mondrian\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6587\u4ef6\u5185\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u590d\u5e03\u5c40\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The scalability concepts underlying the ScrumScale model are\nclarified in this design science research, which also utilizes coordination\ntheory. This paper describes the open banking case study, where a legacy\nbanking system becomes open. This challenges the scalability of this legacy\nsystem. The first step in understanding this challenge is to elicit the new\nscalability requirements.

Previous works typically utilize\ninput-output examples as the specification for spreadsheet formula synthesis,\nwhere each input-output pair simulates a separate row in the spreadsheet.\nHowever, this formulation does not fully capture the rich context in real-world\nspreadsheets. First, spreadsheet data entries are organized as tables, thus\nrows and columns are not necessarily independent from each other. In addition,\nmany spreadsheet tables include headers, which provide high-level descriptions\nof the cell data.

This paper\nexplores a novel mathematical concept, the semilink, that combines pairs of\nsemirings to provide the essential operations for graph analytics, database\noperations, and machine learning. The GraphBLAS standard currently supports\nhypergraphs, hypersparse matrices, the mathematics required for semilinks, and\nseamlessly performs graph, network, and matrix operations. With the addition of\nkey based indices (such as pointers to strings) and semilinks, GraphBLAS can\nbecome a richer associative array algebra and be a plug-in replacement for\nspreadsheets, database tables, and data centric operating systems, enhancing\nthe navigation of unstructured data found in digital hyperspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u534a\u94fe\u201d\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\u5229\u7528\u534a\u73af\u6765\u5904\u7406\u6d77\u91cf\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa GraphBLAS \u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6570\u7ec4\u4ee3\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u3001\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u3001\u4e91\u6587\u6863\u3001\u7f51\u9875\u3001\u6d41\u91cf\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u5305\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6d77\u91cf\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u56fe\u3001\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u5173\u8054\u6570\u7ec4\u4ee3\u6570\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u96c5\u5730\u8868\u793a\u3001\u904d\u5386\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u2014\u2014\u534a\u94fe\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6210\u5bf9\u7684\u534a\u73af\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u672c\u8fd0\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u534a\u94fe\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6210\u5bf9\u7684\u534a\u73af\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u8fd0\u7b97\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u952e\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u6307\u5411\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u6307\u9488\uff09\u548c\u534a\u94fe\uff0cGraphBLAS \u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6570\u7ec4\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8868\u548c\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u8d85\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u3002GraphBLAS \u6807\u51c6\u76ee\u524d\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u56fe\u3001\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u534a\u94fe\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u7f1d\u6267\u884c\u56fe\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002 \u00a0", "conclusion": "GraphBLAS \u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u56fe\u3001\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u534a\u94fe\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u7f1d\u6267\u884c\u56fe\u3001\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6570\u7ec4\u4ee3\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8868\u548c\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u8d85\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u3002"}}

The prospect of increased simulation time\nresulting in slower design iteration forces architects to use simpler models,\nsuch as spreadsheets, when they want to iterate quickly on a design. However,\nthe task of migrating from a simple simulation to one with more detail often\nrequires multiple executions to find where simple models could be effective,\nwhich could be more expensive than running the detailed model in the first\nplace. Also, architects must often rely on intuition to choose these simpler\nmodels, further complicating the problem.\n  In this work, we present a method of bridging the gap between simple and\ndetailed simulation by monitoring simulation behavior online and automatically\nswapping out detailed models with simpler statistical approximations. We\ndemonstrate the potential of our methodology by implementing it in the\nopen-source simulator SVE-Cachesim to swap out the level one data cache (L1D)\nwithin a memory hierarchy. This proof of concept demonstrates that our\ntechnique can handle a non-trivial use-case in not just approximation of local\ntime-invariant statistics, but also those that vary with time (e.g., the L1D is\na form of a time-series function), and downstream side-effects (e.g., the L1D\nfilters accesses for the level two cache). Our simulation swaps out the\nbuilt-in cache model with only an 8% error in the simulated cycle count while\nusing the approximated cache models for over 90% of the simulation, and our\nsimpler models require two to eight times less computation per \"execution\" of\nthe model", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u4eff\u771f\u8017\u65f6\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u8fd0\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u4e14\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f4\u89c9\u9009\u62e9\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u76d1\u63a7\u4eff\u771f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728SVE-Cachesim\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66ff\u6362\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e2d\u7684L1D\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u53d8\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\uff08\u4f8b\u5982L1D\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u51fd\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u7684\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u4f8b\u5982L1D\u8fc7\u6ee4L2\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\uff09\u3002\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8690%\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7f13\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u62df\u5468\u671f\u8ba1\u6570\u4ec5\u67098%\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bcf\u6b21\u6267\u884c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e862\u52308\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u76d1\u63a7\u4eff\u771f\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u7528\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u7b80\u5355\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u4eff\u771f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Leam features an interactive user\ninterface for running text analysis workflows, a new data model for managing\nmultiple atomic and composite data types, and an expressive algebra that\ncaptures diverse sets of operations representing various stages of text\nanalysis and enables coordination among different components of the system,\nincluding data, code, and visualizations. We report our current progress in\nLeam development while demonstrating its usefulness with usage examples.\nFinally, we outline a number of enhancements to Leam and identify several\nresearch directions for developing an interactive visual text analysis system.", "AI": {"tldr": "Leam\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u4f18\u70b9\u4e8e\u4e00\u8eab\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u3001\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5305\u542b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u73b0\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u65e2\u5b9a\u5b9e\u8df5\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLeam\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd0\u884c\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u3001\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u539f\u5b50\u548c\u590d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6355\u83b7\u5404\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4ee3\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u62a5\u544a\u4e86Leam\u5f00\u53d1\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Leam\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u73b0\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u65e2\u5b9a\u5b9e\u8df5\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

While spreadsheets\nare widely used yet are challenging to interact with, especially on mobile\ndevices, using them in VR has not been explored in depth. A special uniqueness\nof the domain is the contrast between the immersive and large display space\nafforded by VR, contrasted by the very limited interaction space that may be\nafforded for the information worker on the go, such as an airplane seat or a\nsmall work-space. To close this gap, we present a tool-set for enhancing\nspreadsheet interaction on tablets using immersive VR headsets and pen-based\ninput. This combination opens up many possibilities for enhancing the\nproductivity for spreadsheet interaction. We propose to use the space around\nand in front of the tablet for enhanced visualization of spreadsheet data and\nmeta-data. For example, extending sheet display beyond the bounds of the\nphysical screen, or easier debugging by uncovering hidden dependencies between\nsheet's cells. Combining the precise on-screen input of a pen with spatial\nsensing around the tablet, we propose tools for the efficient creation and\nediting of spreadsheets functions such as off-the-screen layered menus,\nvisualization of sheets dependencies, and gaze-and-touch-based switching\nbetween spreadsheet tabs.

The results show a\nlarge volume of spreadsheets being created and used, that the profile of\nspreadsheet developers is typical of other studies of spreadsheet use and the\nneed for the organisation to have clear principles and guidelines for the\ndevelopment of spreadsheet models in the organisation to ensure data integrity,\nreduce duplication of effort and to optimise the use of spreadsheets to meet\nthe institutions goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u82f1\u56fd\u4e00\u6240\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u4e2d\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u8981\u5236\u5b9a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6307\u5357\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u4e2d\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u82f1\u56fd\u4e00\u6240\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4e86\u5b66\u672f\u6ce8\u518c\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u95e8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5185\u5bb9\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u57f9\u8bad\u3001\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u76ee\u7684\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3001\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u6784\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u7c7b\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u8be5\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5236\u5b9a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u539f\u5219\u548c\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u673a\u6784\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

One of the many possible application scenarios\nfor this task is to provide users of a spreadsheet program proactively with\nrecommendations for related structured content on the Web.

While an insight into data uncertainty can help in\nmaking better informed decisions, prior research suggests that people often use\ninformal heuristics to reason with probabilities, which leads to incorrect\nconclusions. Moreover, people often ignore or simplify uncertainty. To\nunderstand how people currently encounter and deal with uncertainty in\nspreadsheets, we conducted an interview study with 11 spreadsheet users from a\nrange of domains.

One way to assess spreadsheet quality is to detect smells which\nattempt to identify parts of spreadsheets that are hard to comprehend or\nmaintain and which are more likely to be the root source of bugs.\nUnfortunately, current spreadsheet smell detection techniques suffer from a\nnumber of drawbacks that lead to incorrect or redundant smell reports. For\nexample, the same quality issue is often reported for every copy of a cell,\nwhich may overwhelm users. To deal with these issues, we propose to refine\nspreadsheet smells by exploiting inferred structural information for smell\ndetection. We therefore first provide a detailed description of our static\nanalysis approach to infer clusters and blocks of related cells.

Existing\nsynthesis systems either completely rely on deductive logic techniques that are\nextensively hand-engineered or on purely statistical models that need massive\namounts of data, and in general fail to provide real-time synthesis on\nchallenging benchmarks. In this work, we propose Neural Guided Deductive Search\n(NGDS), a hybrid synthesis technique that combines the best of both symbolic\nlogic techniques and statistical models. Thus, it produces programs that\nsatisfy the provided specifications by construction and generalize well on\nunseen examples, similar to data-driven systems. Our technique effectively\nutilizes the deductive search framework to reduce the learning problem of the\nneural component to a simple supervised learning setup. Further, this allows us\nto both train on sparingly available real-world data and still leverage\npowerful recurrent neural network encoders.

Second, we identify higher-level\nsemantics that have been fragmented and scattered, and reassemble the syntax\nusing concise built-in functions. A comprehensive evaluation has been conducted\nagainst a real-world spreadsheet corpus, which is collected in a leading IT\ncompany for research purpose. The results with over 68,000 spreadsheets with 27\nmillion nest-IF formulae reveal that our approach is able to relieve the smell\nof over 99\\% of nest-IF formulae. Over 50% of the refactorings have reduced\nnesting levels of the nest-IFs by more than a half. In addition, a survey\ninvolving 49 participants indicates that for most cases the participants prefer\nthe refactored formulae, and agree on that such automated refactoring approach\nis necessary and helpful.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u6784\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5d4c\u5957IF\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u4e5f\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5957IF\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u6cd5\u6811\uff08AST\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u79fb\u9664AST\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u88ab\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u5230\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u5185\u7f6e\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u6765\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u91cd\u6784\u5d4c\u5957IF\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u8fc799%\u7684\u5d4c\u5957IF\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc750%\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u5c06\u5d4c\u5957IF\u7684\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u7ea7\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u534a\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u7814\u4e5f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u91cd\u6784\u540e\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8be5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u4e14\u6709\u7528\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAST\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cd\u6784\u5d4c\u5957IF\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5305\u542b2700\u4e07\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5957IF\u516c\u5f0f\u768468000\u591a\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u740699%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u5d4c\u5957IF\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u5d4c\u5957\u5c42\u7ea7\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u7814\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u91cd\u6784\u540e\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8be5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u4e14\u6709\u7528\u7684\u3002"}}

They appear as serializers and\ndeserializers, as database views and view updaters, and more. Manually building\nbidirectional transformations---by writing two separate functions that are\nintended to be inverses---is tedious and error prone. A better approach is to\nuse a domain-specific language in which both directions can be written as a\nsingle expression. However, these domain-specific languages can be difficult to\nprogram in, requiring programmers to manage fiddly details while working in a\ncomplex type system.\n  To solve this, we present Optician, a tool for type-directed synthesis of\nbijective string transformers. The inputs to Optician are two ordinary regular\nexpressions representing two data formats and a few concrete examples for\ndisambiguation. The output is a well-typed program in Boomerang (a\nbidirectional language based on the theory of lenses). The main technical\nchallenge involves navigating the vast program search space efficiently enough.\nUnlike most prior work on type-directed synthesis, our system operates in the\ncontext of a language with a rich equivalence relation on types (the theory of\nregular expressions). We synthesize terms of a equivalent language and convert\nthose generated terms into our lens language. We prove the correctness of our\nsynthesis algorithm. We also demonstrate empirically that our new language\nchanges the synthesis problem from one that admits intractable solutions to one\nthat admits highly efficient solutions.

However, spreadsheets are not\nscalable, unlike database systems. On the other hand, database systems, while\nhighly scalable, do not support interactivity as a first-class primitive. We\nare developing DataSpread, to holistically integrate spreadsheets as a\nfront-end interface with databases as a back-end datastore, providing\nscalability to spreadsheets, and interactivity to databases, an integration we\nterm presentational data management (PDM). In this paper, we make a first step\ntowards this vision: developing a storage engine for PDM, studying how to\nflexibly represent spreadsheet data within a database and how to support and\nmaintain access by position. We first conduct an extensive survey of\nspreadsheet use to motivate our functional requirements for a storage engine\nfor PDM.

The nodes\nin this network represent users and entities. The edges represent communication\nbetween users and relations to the entities. We suggest taking a different\napproach to the network extraction and use attachments shared between users as\nthe edges. The motivation for this is two-fold. First, attachments represent\nthe \"intimacy\" manifestation of the relation's strength. Second, the\nstatistical analysis of private email archives that we collected and Enron\nemail corpus shows that the attachments contribute in average around 80-90% to\nthe archive's disk-space usage, which means that most of the data is presently\nignored in the SNA of email archives. Consequently, we hypothesize that this\napproach might provide more insight into the social structure of the email\narchive. We extract the communication and shared attachments networks from\nEnron email corpus. We further analyze degree, betweenness, closeness, and\neigenvector centrality measures in both networks and review the differences and\nwhat can be learned from them.

Unfortunately, end-users and data scientists typically\nstruggle with many data completion tasks that require non-trivial programming\nexpertise.

The key technical\nnovelty of our approach is a new version space learning algorithm that is based\non finite tree automata (FTA). The use of FTAs in the learning algorithm leads\nto a more compact representation that allows more sharing between programs that\nare consistent with the examples.

A domain-specific form of such synthesis\nhas been recently deployed in a widely used spreadsheet software product. In\nthis paper we contribute to foundations of such techniques and present a\ncomplete algorithm for synthesis of a class of recursive functions defined by\nstructural recursion over a given algebraic data type definition. The functions\nwe consider map an algebraic data type to a string; they are useful for, e.g.,\npretty printing and serialization of programs and data. We formalize our\nproblem as learning deterministic sequential top-down tree-to-string\ntransducers with a single state.\n  The first problem we consider is learning a tree-to-string transducer from\nany set of input/output examples provided by the user. We show that this\nproblem is NP-complete in general, but can be solved in polynomial time under a\n(practically useful) closure condition that each subtree of a tree in the\ninput/output example set is also part of the input/output examples.\n  Because coming up with relevant input/output examples may be difficult for\nthe user while creating hard constraint problems for the synthesizer, we also\nstudy a more automated active learning scenario in which the algorithm chooses\nthe inputs for which the user provides the outputs. Our algorithm asks a\nworst-case linear number of queries as a function of the size of the algebraic\ndata type definition to determine a unique transducer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ece\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u5c06\u4ee3\u6570\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u72b6\u6001\u6811\u5230\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u4f7f\u5728NP-\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f7f\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u5b9a\u884c\u4e3a\u793a\u4f8b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5c06\u4ee3\u6570\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u5355\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u987a\u5e8f\u81ea\u9876\u5411\u4e0b\u6811\u5230\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8f93\u5165/\u8f93\u51fa\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6811\u5230\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u5e38\u662fNP-\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u95ed\u5305\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u4ee3\u6570\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5185\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u95ed\u5305\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u8f93\u5165/\u8f93\u51fa\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6811\u5230\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08NP-\u5b8c\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff09\u3002\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4ee3\u6570\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5185\u786e\u5b9a\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u9012\u5f52\u5728\u4ee3\u6570\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u4e00\u7c7b\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5c06\u4ee3\u6570\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff09\u7684\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, end users rarely use version\ncontrol tools to document spreadsheet version information. Thus, the\nspreadsheet version information is missing, and different versions of a\nspreadsheet coexist as individual and similar spreadsheets. Existing approaches\ntry to recover spreadsheet version information through clustering these similar\nspreadsheets based on spreadsheet filenames or related email conversation.\nHowever, the applicability and accuracy of existing clustering approaches are\nlimited due to the necessary information (e.g., filenames and email\nconversation) is usually missing. We inspected the versioned spreadsheets in\nVEnron, which is extracted from the Enron Corporation. In VEnron, the different\nversions of a spreadsheet are clustered into an evolution group. We observed\nthat the versioned spreadsheets in each evolution group exhibit certain common\nfeatures (e.g., similar table headers and worksheet names). Based on this\nobservation, we proposed an automatic clustering algorithm, SpreadCluster.\nSpreadCluster learns the criteria of features from the versioned spreadsheets\nin VEnron, and then automatically clusters spreadsheets with the similar\nfeatures into the same evolution group. We applied SpreadCluster on all\nspreadsheets in the Enron corpus. The evaluation result shows that\nSpreadCluster could cluster spreadsheets with higher precision and recall rate\nthan the filename-based approach used by VEnron. Based on the clustering result\nby SpreadCluster, we further created a new versioned spreadsheet corpus\nVEnron2, which is much bigger than VEnron. We also applied SpreadCluster on the\nother two spreadsheet corpora FUSE and EUSES.
