Given the time and\nexpertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent\nneed for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are\nill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned\nrectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,\ngrid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,\nsuch as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this\npaper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by\na seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We\nthen introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision\nreflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner\noutperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\\%. We further find that through\nvision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with\nalignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes\nand data is available at Github."}
