Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data, supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks. SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets. Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/SheetBrain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格因其复杂和灵活的结构在大型语言模型中受到关注，但其多样的格式和用途使得表格理解任务面临挑战，缺乏通用的方法。

Method: 论文通过引入表格输入表示的分类法和表格理解任务来介绍关键概念，并指出领域内的关键研究空白。

Result: 论文发现并强调了三个关键研究空白：1) 大多数任务侧重于检索，需要最少的推理；2) 模型在处理复杂表格结构、大型表格、长上下文或多表格场景时面临显著挑战；3) 模型在不同表格表示和格式上的泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 表格理解领域需要进一步研究，以解决当前存在的挑战，特别是在深度推理、复杂表格处理和模型泛化能力方面。

Abstract: Tables have gained significant attention in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to their complex and flexible structure. Unlike linear text inputs, tables are two-dimensional, encompassing formats that range from well-structured database tables to complex, multi-layered spreadsheets, each with different purposes. This diversity in format and purpose has led to the development of specialized methods and tasks, instead of universal approaches, making navigation of table understanding tasks challenging. To address these challenges, this paper introduces key concepts through a taxonomy of tabular input representations and an introduction of table understanding tasks. We highlight several critical gaps in the field that indicate the need for further research: (1) the predominance of retrieval-focused tasks that require minimal reasoning beyond mathematical and logical operations; (2) significant challenges faced by models when processing complex table structures, large-scale tables, length context, or multi-table scenarios; and (3) the limited generalization of models across different tabular representations and formats.

### [3] [A Conditional GAN for Tabular Data Generation with Probabilistic Sampling of Latent Subspaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00472)
*Leonidas Akritidis,Panayiotis Bozanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ctdGAN是一种条件GAN，用于解决表格数据集中的类不平衡问题。它通过空间划分和新的概率采样策略，在原始数据分布的子空间中生成高质量样本，显著提高了分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据普遍存在类不平衡问题，导致机器学习任务性能下降。现有GAN模型在合成少数类数据时，未充分考虑输入样本的向量子空间，导致数据生成位置随意，且条件采样效果不佳。

Method: ctdGAN首先执行空间划分步骤，为输入样本分配聚类标签。然后，利用这些标签通过新颖的概率采样策略和惩罚聚类及类别误判的新损失函数来合成样本。此外，引入了简单有效的聚类缩放技术，以捕获多个特征模式。

Result: 在14个不平衡数据集上的全面评估表明，ctdGAN在生成高保真样本和提高分类准确性方面表现出优越性。

Conclusion: ctdGAN通过考虑数据子空间和改进条件采样机制，有效解决了表格数据中的类不平衡问题，并显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: The tabular form constitutes the standard way of representing data in relational database systems and spreadsheets. But, similarly to other forms, tabular data suffers from class imbalance, a problem that causes serious performance degradation in a wide variety of machine learning tasks. One of the most effective solutions dictates the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in order to synthesize artificial data instances for the under-represented classes. Despite their good performance, none of the proposed GAN models takes into account the vector subspaces of the input samples in the real data space, leading to data generation in arbitrary locations. Moreover, the class labels are treated in the same manner as the other categorical variables during training, so conditional sampling by class is rendered less effective. To overcome these problems, this study presents ctdGAN, a conditional GAN for alleviating class imbalance in tabular datasets. Initially, ctdGAN executes a space partitioning step to assign cluster labels to the input samples. Subsequently, it utilizes these labels to synthesize samples via a novel probabilistic sampling strategy and a new loss function that penalizes both cluster and class mis-predictions. In this way, ctdGAN is trained to generate samples in subspaces that resemble those of the original data distribution. We also introduce several other improvements, including a simple, yet effective cluster-wise scaling technique that captures multiple feature modes without affecting data dimensionality. The exhaustive evaluation of ctdGAN with 14 imbalanced datasets demonstrated its superiority in generating high fidelity samples and improving classification accuracy.

TL;DR: 这项初步研究探讨了新加坡科技设计大学500多名一年级工程和建筑学生在为期13周的人工智能增强设计课程中对AI使用的反思。学生通过“工具-队友-不使用”的视角反思AI，从而将效率转化为创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在设计课程中，帮助学生学习如何使用AI进行创新而不仅仅是自动化，并反思代理、伦理和背景，而不仅仅是提示词工程。

Method: 一项为期13周的试点研究，涉及500多名学生，通过结构化反思表格、插图简报以及教师和研究人员的笔记进行定性编码分析。

Result: 学生通过AI实现了加速原型制作、快速技能习得、迭代提示词优化、用户研究期间有目的的“关闭”以及识别幻觉的新兴例程。学生不仅利用AI提高速度，还学会拒绝其输出，发明自己的幻觉演练，并将节省的时间投入到更深入的用户研究中，从而将效率转化为创新。

Conclusion: 将AI应用转化为可评估的设计习惯；奖励选择性不使用可以培养对幻觉有意识的工作流程；通过工具访问、反思、角色标记和竞赛奖励的协调结合，可以在不损害问责制的情况下扩展教育中的AI创新。

Abstract: This pilot study traces students' reflections on the use of AI in a 13-week foundational design course enrolling over 500 first-year engineering and architecture students at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. The course was an AI-enhanced design course, with several interventions to equip students with AI based design skills. Students were required to reflect on whether the technology was used as a tool (instrumental assistant), a teammate (collaborative partner), or neither (deliberate non-use). By foregrounding this three-way lens, students learned to use AI for innovation rather than just automation and to reflect on agency, ethics, and context rather than on prompt crafting alone. Evidence stems from coursework artefacts: thirteen structured reflection spreadsheets and eight illustrated briefs submitted, combined with notes of teachers and researchers. Qualitative coding of these materials reveals shared practices brought about through the inclusion of Gen-AI, including accelerated prototyping, rapid skill acquisition, iterative prompt refinement, purposeful "switch-offs" during user research, and emergent routines for recognizing hallucinations. Unexpectedly, students not only harnessed Gen-AI for speed but (enabled by the tool-teammate-neither triage) also learned to reject its outputs, invent their own hallucination fire-drills, and divert the reclaimed hours into deeper user research, thereby transforming efficiency into innovation. The implications of the approach we explore shows that: we can transform AI uptake into an assessable design habit; that rewarding selective non-use cultivates hallucination-aware workflows; and, practically, that a coordinated bundle of tool access, reflection, role tagging, and public recognition through competition awards allows AI based innovation in education to scale without compromising accountability.
