TL;DR: TaFo is a neuro-symbolic approach that automatically generates conditional formatting suggestions for tables by learning both the rule trigger and the associated visual formatting properties.

Motivation: Creating conditional formatting (CF) rules in spreadsheet software is complex and requires technical knowledge. Existing methods rely on user input, making formatting not fully automated.

Method: TaFo uses a neuro-symbolic approach inspired by component-based synthesis systems, extending them with semantic knowledge of language models and diversity-preserving rule ranking. It uniquely incorporates value-based formatting.

Result: TaFo generates more accurate, diverse, and complete formatting suggestions than current systems, outperforming them by 15.6%-26.5% on matching user-added ground truth rules.

Conclusion: TaFo makes formatting completely predictive and automated by removing the dependency on user specification.

Abstract: Spreadsheet manipulation software are widely used for data management and analysis of tabular data, yet the creation of conditional formatting (CF) rules remains a complex task requiring technical knowledge and experience with specific platforms. In this paper we present TaFo, a neuro-symbolic approach to generating CF suggestions for tables, addressing common challenges such as user unawareness, difficulty in rule creation, and inadequate user interfaces. TaFo takes inspiration from component based synthesis systems and extends them with semantic knowledge of language models and a diversity preserving rule ranking.Unlike previous methods focused on structural formatting, TaFo uniquely incorporates value-based formatting, automatically learning both the rule trigger and the associated visual formatting properties for CF rules. By removing the dependency on user specification used by existing techniques in the form of formatted examples or natural language instruction, TaFo makes formatting completely predictive and automated for the user. To evaluate TaFo, we use a corpus of 1.8 Million public workbooks with CF and manual formatting. We compare TaFo against a diverse set of symbolic and neural systems designed for or adapted for the task of table formatting. Our results show that TaFo generates more accurate, diverse and complete formatting suggestions than current systems and outperforms these by 15.6\%--26.5\% on matching user added ground truth rules in tables.
