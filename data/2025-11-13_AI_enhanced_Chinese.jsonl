Despite their impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We hypothesise that a \"test first\" methodology provides both technical constraints and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate, verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking, prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u903b\u8f91\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\uff08TDD\uff09\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u903b\u8f91\u65f6\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\uff08TDD\uff09\u4e0eLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u201c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f18\u5148\u201d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u6280\u672f\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u652f\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5b83\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u5305\u542b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548cTDD\u63d0\u793a\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u201c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f18\u5148\u201d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4f7fLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u601d\u7ef4\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7528\u6237\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9080\u8bf7\u5408\u4f5c\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5584\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684LLM\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

Given the time and expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete, grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics, such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\\%. We further find that through vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies.
