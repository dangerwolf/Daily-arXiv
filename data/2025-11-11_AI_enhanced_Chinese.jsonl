Dastgahi music serves as the underlying theoretical system for both Iranian art music and certain folk traditions. At the heart of Iranian classical music lies the radif, a foundational repertoire that organizes melodic material central to performance and pedagogy.\n  In this study, we introduce a digital corpus representing the complete non-metrical radif repertoire, covering all 13 existing components of this repertoire. We provide MIDI files (about 281 minutes in total) and data spreadsheets describing notes, note durations, intervals, and hierarchical structures for 228 pieces of music. We faithfully represent the tonality including quarter-tones, and the non-metric aspect. Furthermore, we provide supporting basic statistics, and measures of complexity and similarity over the corpus.\n  Our corpus provides a platform for computational studies of Iranian classical music. Researchers might employ it in studying melodic patterns, investigating improvisational styles, or for other tasks in music information retrieval, music theory, and computational (ethno)musicology.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unexpected Error", "motivation": "Error code: 503 - [{'error': {'code': 503, 'message': 'The model is overloaded.

This phase encompasses a myriad of tasks: parsing data, restructuring it for analysis, repairing inaccuracies, merging sources, eliminating duplicates, and ensuring overall data integrity. Traditional approaches, typically through manual coding in languages such as Python or using spreadsheets, are not only laborious but also error-prone. These issues range from missing entries and formatting inconsistencies to data type inaccuracies, all of which can affect the quality of downstream tasks if not properly corrected. To address these challenges, we present Buckaroo, a visualization system to highlight discrepancies in data and enable on-the-spot corrections through direct manipulations of visual objects. Buckaroo (1) automatically finds \"interesting\" data groups that exhibit anomalies compared to the rest of the groups and recommends them for inspection; (2) suggests wrangling actions that the user can choose to repair the anomalies; and (3) allows users to visually manipulate their data by displaying the effects of their wrangling actions and offering the ability to undo or redo these actions, which supports the iterative nature of data wrangling.

However, it is important to validate whether the NL generated by the LLM is indeed accurate to be beneficial for fine-tuning. In this paper, we provide empirical results on the impact of validating these synthetic training examples with surrogate objectives that evaluate the accuracy of the synthetic annotations.

In a spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data by computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However, identifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables remains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the problem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot tables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of recommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works inadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to consider the problem of pivot table diversification.\n  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted diverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k recommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is insightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences, while also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each other, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical contributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a single pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a scalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot tables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce the combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently scales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we present several case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over commercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86SAGE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u8350k\u4e2a\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u900f\u89c6\u8868\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u63a8\u8350\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002SAGE\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u4e2a\u900f\u89c6\u8868\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u900f\u89c6\u8868\u96c6\u5408\u5f7c\u6b64\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u6c47\u603b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u6d1e\u5bdf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u900f\u89c6\u8868\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u4fbf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6c47\u603b\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u7528\u900f\u89c6\u8868\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u900f\u89c6\u8868\u591a\u6837\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u8350\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SAGE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u8d21\u732e\uff1a1) \u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u5355\u4e2a\u900f\u89c6\u8868\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u900f\u89c6\u8868\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b2) \u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7ec4\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u7ec4\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u900f\u89c6\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAGE\u4f18\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86SAGE\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u900f\u89c6\u8868\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u7528\u6237\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u900f\u89c6\u8868\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Sharing expertise is essential for the retention of important technical skillsets within organisations, but previous studies suggest that spreadsheet experts often fail to disseminate their knowledge to others. We suggest that social norms and beliefs surrounding the value of spreadsheet use significantly influence user engagement in sharing behaviours. To explore this, we conducted 31 semi-structured interviews with professional spreadsheet users from two separate samples. We found that spreadsheet providers face challenges in adapting highly personalised strategies to often subjective standards and evaluating the appropriate social timing of sharing. In addition, conflicted self-evaluations of one's spreadsheet expertise, dismissive normative beliefs about the value of this knowledge, and concerns about the potential disruptions associated with collaboration can further deter sharing. We suggest these observations reflect the challenges of long-term learning in feature-rich software designed primarily with initial learnability in mind. We therefore provide implications for design to navigate this tension.

This paper 1) reviews prior frameworks on K-12 data tools; 2) proposes data-driven learning outcomes that can be accomplished by incorporating spreadsheets into the curriculum; and 3) discusses how spreadsheets can help develop data acumen and computational fluency. We provide example class activities, identify challenges and barriers to adoption, suggest pedagogical approaches to ease the learning curve for instructors and students, and discuss the need for professional development to facilitate deeper use of spreadsheets for data science and STEM disciplines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5de5\u5177\u5728K-12\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u57f9\u517b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5b9e\u65bd\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5de5\u5177\u5728K-12\u5b66\u751f\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u4e92\u52a8\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u57f9\u517b\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86K-12\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u878d\u5165\u8bfe\u7a0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5982\u4f55\u5e2e\u52a9\u53d1\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bfe\u5802\u6d3b\u52a8\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5e08\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e13\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u57f9\u517bK-12\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u63a8\u5e7f\u548c\u6df1\u5165\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u662fK-12\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u53d1\u5c55\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u548cSTEM\u5b66\u79d1\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u57f9\u8bad\u6765\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning abilities, they continue to struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic reasoning over tabular data, especially in complex scenarios. Spreadsheet formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks, enabling a 7B model to outperform OpenAI o1 on table understanding. This highlights the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002Formula Tuning (Fortune) \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u503c\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b (LMs) \u5728\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6216\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u516c\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u5a92\u4ecb\u6765\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Formula Tuning (Fortune)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60 (RL) \u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u7b54\u3002Formula Tuning \u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u516c\u5f0f\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5f0f\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "Formula Tuning \u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u6570\u503c\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a 7B \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86 OpenAI o1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u516c\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f Fortune\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u8fdb\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u683c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Attackers increasingly employ sophisticated encryption methods, such as entropy reduction through Base64 encoding, and partial or intermittent encryption to evade traditional detection methods. This study explores the dynamic battle between adversaries who continuously refine encryption strategies and defenders developing advanced countermeasures to protect vulnerable data. We investigate the application of online incremental machine learning algorithms designed to predict file encryption activities despite adversaries evolving obfuscation techniques. Our analysis utilizes an extensive dataset of 32.6 GB, comprising 11,928 files across multiple formats, including Microsoft Word documents (doc), PowerPoint presentations (ppt), Excel spreadsheets (xlsx), image formats (jpg, jpeg, png, tif, gif), PDFs (pdf), audio (mp3), and video (mp4) files.

We describe in detail a deidentification workflow for DICOM data using facilities in XNAT, together with independent tools in the XNAT \"ecosystem\". We list different contexts in which deidentification might be needed, based on our prior experience. The starting point for participation in the Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B) challenge was a set of pre-existing local methodologies, which were adapted during the validation phase of the challenge. Our result in the test phase was 97.91\\%, considerably lower than our peers, due largely to an arcane technical incompatibility of our methodology with the challenge's Synapse platform, which prevented us receiving feedback during the validation phase. Post-submission, additional discrepancy reports from the organisers and via the MIDI-B Continuous Benchmarking facility, enabled us to improve this score significantly to 99.61\\%. An entirely rule-based approach was shown to be capable of removing all name-related information in the test corpus, but exhibited failures in dealing fully with address data. Initial experiments using published machine-learning models to remove addresses were partially successful but showed the models to be \"over-aggressive\" on other types of free-text data, leading to a slight overall degradation in performance to 99.54\\%. Future development will therefore focus on improving address-recognition capabilities, but also on better removal of identifiable data burned into the image pixels. Several technical aspects relating to the \"answer key\" are still under discussion with the challenge organisers, but we estimate that our percentage of genuine deidentification failures on the MIDI-B test corpus currently stands at 0.19\\%.

However, a lack of shared understanding of AI risks can impede our ability to comprehensively discuss, research, and react to them. This paper addresses this gap by creating an AI Risk Repository to serve as a common frame of reference. This comprises a living database of 777 risks extracted from 43 taxonomies, which can be filtered based on two overarching taxonomies and easily accessed, modified, and updated via our website and online spreadsheets. We construct our Repository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured classifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our taxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level Causal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1) Entity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3) Timing: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination & toxicity, (2) Privacy & security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors & misuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic & environmental, and (7) AI system safety, failures, & limitations. These are further divided into 23 subdomains. The AI Risk Repository is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to rigorously curate, analyze, and extract AI risk frameworks into a publicly accessible, comprehensive, extensible, and categorized risk database. This creates a foundation for a more coordinated, coherent, and complete approach to defining, auditing, and managing the risks posed by AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unexpected Error", "motivation": "Error code: 503 - [{'error': {'code': 503, 'message': 'The model is overloaded.

In response, we introduce SpreadsheetLLM, pioneering an efficient encoding method designed to unleash and optimize LLMs' powerful understanding and reasoning capability on spreadsheets. Initially, we propose a vanilla serialization approach that incorporates cell addresses, values, and formats. However, this approach was limited by LLMs' token constraints, making it impractical for most applications. To tackle this challenge, we develop SheetCompressor, an innovative encoding framework that compresses spreadsheets effectively for LLMs. It comprises three modules: structural-anchor-based compression, inverse index translation, and data-format-aware aggregation. It significantly improves performance in the spreadsheet table detection task, outperforming the vanilla approach by 25.6% in GPT4's in-context learning setting. Moreover, fine-tuned LLM with SheetCompressor has an average compression ratio of 25 times, and achieves a state-of-the-art 78.9% F1 score, surpassing the best existing models by 12.3%. Finally, we propose Chain of Spreadsheet for downstream tasks of spreadsheet understanding and validate it in a new and demanding spreadsheet QA task. We methodically leverage the inherent layout and structure of spreadsheets, demonstrating that SpreadsheetLLM is highly effective across a variety of spreadsheet tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unexpected Error", "motivation": "Error code: 503 - [{'error': {'code': 503, 'message': 'The model is overloaded.

Large language model (LLM) has been recently attempted for automatic spreadsheet manipulation but has not yet been investigated in complicated and realistic tasks where reasoning challenges exist (e.g., long horizon manipulation with multi-step reasoning and ambiguous requirements). To bridge the gap with the real-world requirements, we introduce SheetRM, a benchmark featuring long-horizon and multi-category tasks with reasoning-dependent manipulation caused by real-life challenges. To mitigate the above challenges, we further propose SheetAgent, a novel autonomous agent that utilizes the power of LLMs. SheetAgent consists of three collaborative modules: Planner, Informer, and Retriever, achieving both advanced reasoning and accurate manipulation over spreadsheets without human interaction through iterative task reasoning and reflection.

Do users actually get closer to their desired outcome over multiple iterations of their prompts? These questions are crucial when no gold-standard labels are available to measure progress. This paper investigates a scenario in LLM-powered data labeling, \"prompting in the dark,\" where users iteratively prompt LLMs to label data without using manually-labeled benchmarks. We developed PromptingSheet, a Google Sheets add-on that enables users to compose, revise, and iteratively label data through spreadsheets. Through a study with 20 participants, we found that prompting in the dark was highly unreliable -- only 9 participants improved labeling accuracy after four or more iterations. Automated prompt optimization tools like DSPy also struggled when few gold labels were available. Our findings highlight the importance of gold labels and the needs, as well as the risks, of automated support in human prompt engineering, providing insights for future tool design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u793a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u201c\u5728\u9ed1\u6697\u4e2d\u63d0\u793a\u201d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u6ca1\u6709\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u6807\u7b7e\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u8fdb\u5c55\u65f6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\u7528\u6237\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5176\u671f\u671b\u7ed3\u679c\uff1f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u4e8eLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u573a\u666f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aPromptingSheet\u7684Google Sheets\u63d2\u4ef6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7f16\u5199\u3001\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9879\u670920\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u50cfDSPy\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u7b7e\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u201c\u5728\u9ed1\u6697\u4e2d\u63d0\u793a\u201d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u2014\u2014\u5728\u56db\u6b21\u6216\u66f4\u591a\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\uff0c\u53ea\u67099\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u7b7e\u8f83\u5c11\u65f6\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u652f\u6301\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

The project is defined by three central characteristics: it is a reference corpus, a historical corpus, and a syntactically deeply annotated treebank. As a historical corpus, GiesKaNe aims to establish connections with both historical and contemporary corpora, ensuring its relevance across temporal and linguistic contexts. The compilation process strikes the balance between innovation and adherence to standards, addressing both internal project goals and the broader interests of the research community. The methodological complexity of such a project is managed through a complementary interplay of human expertise and machine-assisted processes. The article discusses foundational topics such as tokenization, normalization, sentence definition, tagging, parsing, and inter-annotator agreement, alongside advanced considerations. These include comparisons between grammatical models, annotation schemas, and established de facto annotation standards as well as the integration of human and machine collaboration. Notably, a novel method for machine-assisted classification of texts along the continuum of conceptual orality and literacy is proposed, offering new perspectives on text selection.

Despite recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for various image understanding tasks, accurately identifying and extracting the structures and relationships depicted in diagrams continues to pose significant challenges. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a text-driven approach that bypasses reliance on VLMs' visual recognition capabilities. Instead, it utilizes the editable source files--such as xlsx, pptx or docx--where diagram elements (e.g., shapes, lines, annotations) are preserved as textual metadata. In our proof-of-concept, we extracted diagram information from xlsx-based system design documents and transformed the extracted shape data into textual input for Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach allowed the LLM to analyze relationships and generate responses to business-oriented questions without the bottleneck of image-based processing. Experimental comparisons with a VLM-based method demonstrated that the proposed text-driven framework yielded more accurate answers for questions requiring detailed comprehension of diagram structures.The results obtained in this study are not limited to the tested .xlsx files but can also be extended to diagrams in other documents with source files, such as Office pptx and docx formats. These findings highlight the feasibility of circumventing VLM constraints through direct textual extraction from original source files. By enabling robust diagram understanding through LLMs, our method offers a promising path toward enhanced workflow efficiency and information analysis in real-world business scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u8868\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\uff08\u5982xlsx\u3001pptx\u6216docx\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8be6\u7ec6\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u8868\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e1a\u52a1\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u56fe\u8868\u4e2d\u63cf\u7ed8\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eVLMs\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\uff08\u5982xlsx\u3001pptx\u6216docx\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u8868\u5143\u7d20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u7559\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ecexlsx\u6587\u4ef6\u63d0\u53d6\u56fe\u8868\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aLLM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5173\u7cfb\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u4e1a\u52a1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8be6\u7ec6\u7406\u89e3\u56fe\u8868\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e.xlsx\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5e26\u6709\u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u6587\u6863\uff08\u5982Office pptx\u548cdocx\u683c\u5f0f\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u89c4\u907fVLM\u7684\u9650\u5236\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7LLMs\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e1a\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Multi-modal data introduces new opportunities and challenges for disentangling uncertainty: it is commonly assumed in the machine learning community that epistemic uncertainty can be reduced by collecting more data, while aleatoric uncertainty is irreducible. However, this assumption is challenged in modern AI systems when information is obtained from different modalities. This paper introduces an innovative data acquisition framework where uncertainty disentanglement leads to actionable decisions, allowing sampling in two directions: sample size and data modality.

However, the lack of standardized guidelines for FM evaluation and comparison threatens the transparency of FM leaderboards and limits stakeholders' ability to perform effective FM selection. As a first step towards addressing this challenge, our research focuses on understanding how these FM leaderboards operate in real-world scenarios (\"leaderboard operations\") and identifying potential pitfalls and areas for improvement (\"leaderboard smells\"). In this regard, we collect up to 1,045 FM leaderboards from five different sources: GitHub, Hugging Face Spaces, Papers With Code, spreadsheet and independent platform, to examine their documentation and engage in direct communication with leaderboard operators to understand their workflows. Through card sorting and negotiated agreement, we identify five distinct workflow patterns and develop a domain model that captures the key components and their interactions within these workflows. We then identify eight unique types of leaderboard smells in LBOps. By mitigating these smells, SE teams can improve transparency, accountability, and collaboration in current LBOps practices, fostering a more robust and responsible ecosystem for FM comparison and selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08FM\uff09\u6392\u884c\u699c\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684FM\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4FM\u6392\u884c\u699c\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u53d7\u5230\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9FM\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u4e94\u4e2a\u6765\u6e90\uff08GitHub\u3001Hugging Face Spaces\u3001Papers With Code\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u548c\u72ec\u7acb\u5e73\u53f0\uff09\u6536\u96c6\u4e861045\u4e2aFM\u6392\u884c\u699c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u6587\u6863\u5e76\u4e0e\u6392\u884c\u699c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u516b\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6392\u884c\u699c\u201c\u5f02\u5473\u201d\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ca\u5176\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u516b\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6392\u884c\u699c\u201c\u5f02\u5473\u201d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u201c\u5f02\u5473\u201d\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u56e2\u961f\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f53\u524d\u6392\u884c\u699c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3aFM\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Specifically, MiMoTable incorporates two key features. First, the tables in MiMoTable are all spreadsheets used in real-world scenarios, which cover seven domains and contain different types. Second, we define a new criterion with six categories of meta operations for measuring the difficulty of each question in MiMoTable, simultaneously as a new perspective for measuring the difficulty of the existing benchmarks. Experimental results show that Claude-3.5-Sonnet achieves the best performance with 77.4\\% accuracy, indicating that there is still significant room to improve for LLMs on MiMoTable. Furthermore, we grade the difficulty of existing benchmarks according to our new criteria.

On the other hand, it may also provide unprecedented opportunities for users, particularly non-experts, to learn and apply advanced software features and greatly increase the scope and complexity of tasks they can successfully achieve.\n  As an example of a complex knowledge workflow that is subject to risks and opportunities from generative AI, we consider the spreadsheet. AI hallucinations are an important challenge, but they are not the greatest risk posed by generative AI to spreadsheet workflows. Rather, as more work can be safely delegated to AI, the risk is that human critical thinking -- the ability to holistically and rigorously evaluate a problem and its solutions -- is degraded in the process. The solution is to design the interfaces of generative AI systems deliberately to foster and encourage critical thinking in knowledge work, building primarily on a long history of research on critical thinking tools for education.\n  We discuss a prototype system for the activity of critical shortlisting in spreadsheets. The system uses generative AI to suggest shortlisting criteria and applies these criteria to sort rows in a spreadsheet.

Prompt middleware aims to address this barrier by assisting in prompt construction, but barriers remain for users in expressing adequate control so that they can receive AI-responses that match their preferences.\n  We conduct a formative survey (n=38) investigating user needs for control over AI-generated explanations in comprehension tasks, which uncovers a trade-off between standardized but predictable support for prompting, and adaptive but unpredictable support tailored to the user and task. To explore this trade-off, we implement two prompt middleware approaches: Dynamic Prompt Refinement Control (Dynamic PRC) and Static Prompt Refinement Control (Static PRC). The Dynamic PRC approach generates context-specific UI elements that provide prompt refinements based on the user's prompt and user needs from the AI, while the Static PRC approach offers a preset list of generally applicable refinements.\n  We evaluate these two approaches with a controlled user study (n=16) to assess the impact of these approaches on user control of AI responses for crafting better explanations. Results show a preference for the Dynamic PRC approach as it afforded more control, lowered barriers to providing context, and encouraged exploration and reflection of the tasks, but that reasoning about the effects of different generated controls on the final output remains challenging. Drawing on participant feedback, we discuss design implications for future Dynamic PRC systems that enhance user control of AI responses. Our findings suggest that dynamic prompt middleware can improve the user experience of generative AI workflows by affording greater control and guide users to a better AI response.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u5316\u63a7\u5236\uff08Dynamic PRC\uff09\u548c\u9759\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u5316\u63a7\u5236\uff08Static PRC\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aDynamic PRC\u56e0\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u969c\u788d\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u9752\u7750\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u7528\u6237\u6765\u8bf4\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u6784\u5efa\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7b26\u5408\u5176\u504f\u597d\u7684AI\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5f62\u6210\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\uff08n=38\uff09\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u5bf9AI\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u652f\u6301\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002\u636e\u6b64\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u5316\u63a7\u5236\uff08Dynamic PRC\uff09\u548c\u9759\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u5316\u63a7\u5236\uff08Static PRC\uff09\u3002Dynamic PRC\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5b9a\u7684UI\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u800cStatic PRC\u63d0\u4f9b\u9884\u8bbe\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7ec6\u5316\u5217\u8868\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9879\u53d7\u63a7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff08n=16\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u7528\u6237\u504f\u7231Dynamic PRC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u53cd\u601d\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u4ecd\u89c9\u5f97\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u4ef6\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ef6\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u7528\u6237\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684AI\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u52a8\u6001PRC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237\u5bf9AI\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

However, while recent foundation models have reduced the need for developing task-specific datasets and predictors in domains such as language modeling and computer vision, this transfer learning paradigm has not had similar impact in the tabular domain. In this work, we seek to narrow this gap and present TabuLa-8B, a language model for tabular prediction. We define a process for extracting a large, high-quality training dataset from the TabLib corpus, proposing methods for tabular data filtering and quality control. Using the resulting dataset, which comprises over 2.1B rows from over 4M unique tables, we fine-tune a Llama 3-8B large language model (LLM) for tabular data prediction (classification and binned regression) using a novel packing and attention scheme for tabular prediction. Through evaluation across a test suite of 329 datasets, we find that TabuLa-8B has zero-shot accuracy on unseen tables that is over 15 percentage points (pp) higher than random guessing, a feat that is not possible with existing state-of-the-art tabular prediction models (e.g. XGBoost, TabPFN). In the few-shot setting (1-32 shots), without any fine-tuning on the target datasets, TabuLa-8B is 5-15 pp more accurate than XGBoost and TabPFN models that are explicitly trained on equal, or even up to 16x more data.

Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on synthesized queries and simplified spreadsheet files, SpreadsheetBench is built from 912 real questions gathered from online Excel forums, which reflect the intricate needs of users. The associated spreadsheets from the forums contain a variety of tabular data such as multiple tables, non-standard relational tables, and abundant non-textual elements. Furthermore, we propose a more reliable evaluation metric akin to online judge platforms, where multiple spreadsheet files are created as test cases for each instruction, ensuring the evaluation of robust solutions capable of handling spreadsheets with varying values.

The 'Efficiency and Standards for Article Charges' (ESAC) Initiative lists more than 1,000 contracts in its database. We make use of this unique dataset by web-scraping the details of every contract to substantially expand the overview spreadsheet provided by the ESAC Initiative. Based on that hitherto unused data source, we combine qualitative and quantitative methods to conduct an in-depth analysis of the contract characteristics and the TA landscape. Our analysis demonstrates that research institutions seem to be 'trapped' in transformative agreements. Instead of being a bridge towards a fully Open Access world, academia is stuck in the hybrid system. This endows the legacy (non-Open Access) publishing houses with substantial market power.

Our methods employ several key components, including customizable templates that capture metadata standards and that can inform the spreadsheets that investigators use to author metadata, controlled terminologies and ontologies for defining metadata values that can be accessed directly from a spreadsheet, and an interactive Web-based tool that allows users to rapidly identify and fix errors in their spreadsheet-based metadata.

Often, the user doesn't know how to identify or access the right data source. This problem is compounded even further if multiple (and potentially siloed) data sources must be assembled to derive the answer. Recently, various Text-to-SQL applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) have addressed some of these problems by enabling users to ask questions in natural language. However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they fail to cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this paper, we address heterogeneity by introducing the siwarex platform, which enables seamless natural language access to both databases and APIs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of siwarex, we extend the popular Spider dataset and benchmark by replacing some of its tables by data retrieval APIs.

The slow evolution of Excel from an automation tool for ledgers to an IDE for analytics explains why many people have not noticed that Excel includes a fully functional database, an OLAP Engine, multiple statistical programming languages, multiple third-party software libraries, dynamic charts, and real time data connectors. The simplicity of accessing these multiple tools is a low-code framework controlled from the Excel tool that is effectively an IDE. Once we acknowledge Excel's shift from a desk top application to an IDE for analytics, the importance of establishing a comprehensive risk framework for managing this distinctive development environment becomes clear. In this paper we will explain how the current risk framework for spreadsheets needs to be expanded to manage the growing risks of using Excel as an IDE for analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Excel\u5df2\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5f00\u53d1\u73af\u5883\uff08IDE\uff09\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u98ce\u9669\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5c06Excel\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790IDE\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65b0\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8eExcel\u5df2\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u8d26\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4e3a\u5206\u6790IDE\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u8ddf\u4e0a\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u9669\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u89e3\u91ca\u5982\u4f55\u6269\u5c55\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u98ce\u9669\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ba1\u7406\u5c06Excel\u7528\u4f5c\u5206\u6790IDE\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u9610\u660e\u4e86Excel\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790IDE\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u968f\u4e4b\u800c\u6765\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u98ce\u9669\u6846\u67b6\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u5c06Excel\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790IDE\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

We propose three self-supervised challenges with corresponding evaluation metrics to comprehensively evaluate VLMs on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), spatial perception, and visual format recognition. Additionally, we utilize the spreadsheet table detection task to assess the overall performance of VLMs by integrating these challenges. To probe VLMs more finely, we propose three spreadsheet-to-image settings: column width adjustment, style change, and address augmentation. We propose variants of prompts to address the above tasks in different settings. Notably, to leverage the strengths of VLMs in understanding text rather than two-dimensional positioning, we propose to decode cell values on the four boundaries of the table in spreadsheet boundary detection. Our findings reveal that VLMs demonstrate promising OCR capabilities but produce unsatisfactory results due to cell omission and misalignment, and they notably exhibit insufficient spatial and format recognition skills, motivating future work to enhance VLMs' spreadsheet data comprehension capabilities using our methods to generate extensive spreadsheet-image pairs in various settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0VLMs\u5728\u5149\u5b66\u5b57\u7b26\u8bc6\u522b\uff08OCR\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u683c\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5149\u5b66\u5b57\u7b26\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u683c\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30VLM\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1a\u5217\u5bbd\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u6837\u5f0f\u66f4\u6539\u548c\u5730\u5740\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u4f53\u3002\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8fb9\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801\u8868\u683c\u56db\u4e2a\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0a\u7684\u5355\u5143\u683c\u503c\u6765\u5229\u7528VLMs\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "VLMs\u5728OCR\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5355\u5143\u683c\u9057\u6f0f\u548c\u9519\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u5c3d\u5982\u4eba\u610f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u6280\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u5229\u7528\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aVLMs\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

These complex tasks require AI to continuously summarize and improve. Current research often overlooks the importance of converting real-time task experiences into system memory and differentiating the value of existing knowledge for future reference. This paper addresses these issues by evolving external memory models into Memory-Loop Networks for timely memorization and experience referencing. We also enhance a RAG mechanism with knowledge precision segmentation to utilize memory based on value differentiation, and design the MaxMind model for SOTG accordingly.To demonstrate our approach, we developed MaxMind4Sheet, an electronic spreadsheet processing system aligned with the MaxMind philosophy. Comparative experiments with SheetCopilot have demonstrated that the accumulation and recycling of task memories lead to a steady enhancement in task success rate, with an improvement rate of approximately 3%-6% per round in this implementation example. Note that as the memories continue to grow, this cumulative improvement may be substantial. The inclusion of memory recycling can also boost the system's task execution efficiency by up to 25%, and it can address the retraining issue faced by LLMs when handling specialized tasks through memories transfer.These suggest that MaxMind has significant potential to enhance the capabilities and productivity of LLM systems in SOTG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMaxMind\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5b58\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684RAG\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6210\uff08SOTG\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6210\uff08SOTG\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5c06\u5b9e\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee5\u53ca\u533a\u5206\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5916\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ca\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53c2\u8003\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u589e\u5f3aRAG\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u533a\u5206\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5229\u7528\uff1b\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86MaxMind\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7MaxMind4Sheet\uff08\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eSheetCopilot\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u5229\u7528\u4f7f\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7a33\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u6bcf\u8f6e\u6539\u8fdb\u7ea63%-6%\uff1b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5faa\u73af\u53ef\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u8fbe25%\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f20\u8f93\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e13\u4e1a\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "MaxMind\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728SOTG\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We therefore propose a set of data guards: methods and tools for fostering trust in data artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5efa\u7acb\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6838\u67e5\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u904d\u9700\u6c42\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u6570\u636e\u536b\u58eb\u201d\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5236\u54c1\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u51b3\u7b56\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u9700\u8981\u4fe1\u4efb\u6216\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fe1\u4efb\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5236\u54c1\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u3001\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u4eea\u8868\u677f\uff09\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u8005\u548c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6838\u67e5\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u904d\u9700\u6c42\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u6570\u636e\u536b\u58eb\u201d\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57f9\u517b\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5236\u54c1\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In recent years, it has been coupled with machine learning in order to improve the process of phenotyping plants by increasing efficiency in handling large datasets and developing methods for the extraction of specific traits. Previous studies have developed methods to advance these challenges through the application of deep neural networks in tandem with automated cameras; however, the datasets being studied often excluded physical labels. In this study, we used a dataset provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory with 1,672 images of Populus Trichocarpa with white labels displaying treatment (control or drought), block, row, position, and genotype. Optical character recognition (OCR) was used to read these labels on the plants, image segmentation techniques in conjunction with machine learning algorithms were used for morphological classifications, machine learning models were used to predict treatment based on those classifications, and analyzed encoded EXIF tags were used for the purpose of finding leaf size and correlations between phenotypes. We found that our OCR model had an accuracy of 94.31% for non-null text extractions, allowing for the information to be accurately placed in a spreadsheet. Our classification models identified leaf shape, color, and level of brown splotches with an average accuracy of 62.82%, and plant treatment with an accuracy of 60.08%. Finally, we identified a few crucial pieces of information absent from the EXIF tags that prevented the assessment of the leaf size. There was also missing information that prevented the assessment of correlations between phenotypes and conditions. However, future studies could improve upon this to allow for the assessment of these features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528OCR\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5e26\u6709\u7269\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6bdb\u679c\u6768\u56fe\u50cf\u3002OCR\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe94.31%\uff0c\u6027\u72b6\u548c\u5904\u7406\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea6\u4e3a60%\uff0c\u4f46EXIF\u6570\u636e\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53f6\u7247\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8868\u578b\u5173\u8054\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u72b6\u65b9\u9762\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u7f3a\u5c11\u7269\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u7269\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b1,672\u5f20\u5e26\u6709\u7269\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\uff08\u5305\u542b\u5904\u7406\u3001\u533a\u5757\u3001\u884c\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u57fa\u56e0\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u7684\u6bdb\u679c\u6768\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b66\u5b57\u7b26\u8bc6\u522b\uff08OCR\uff09\u8bfb\u53d6\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6280\u672f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b\u5904\u7406\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u7684EXIF\u6807\u7b7e\u4ee5\u5bfb\u627e\u53f6\u7247\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8868\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "OCR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u7a7a\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a94.31%\u3002\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u53f6\u7247\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u989c\u8272\u548c\u8910\u6591\u7a0b\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a62.82%\u3002\u690d\u7269\u5904\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a60.08%\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cEXIF\u6807\u7b7e\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5c11\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5bf9\u53f6\u7247\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u8868\u578b\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5229\u7528OCR\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u5f62\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5904\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1OCR\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5408\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46EXIF\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u9650\u5236\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5bf9\u53f6\u7247\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u8868\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Today, spreadsheets are used by billions of users to manipulate tables, most of whom are neither database experts nor professional programmers.\n  Despite the success of spreadsheets, authoring complex formulas remains challenging, as non-technical users need to look up and understand non-trivial formula syntax. To address this pain point, we leverage the observation that there is often an abundance of similar-looking spreadsheets in the same organization, which not only have similar data, but also share similar computation logic encoded as formulas. We develop an Auto-Formula system that can accurately predict formulas that users want to author in a target spreadsheet cell, by learning and adapting formulas that already exist in similar spreadsheets, using contrastive-learning techniques inspired by \"similar-face recognition\" from compute vision.\n  Extensive evaluations on over 2K test formulas extracted from real enterprise spreadsheets show the effectiveness of Auto-Formula over alternatives.

We develop a theory and taxonomy of such gaps, identifying how they act as barriers to learning, by collecting and analyzing 360 viewer comments from 90 Microsoft Excel video tutorials published by 43 creators across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. We conducted contextual interviews with 8 highly influential tutorial creators to investigate the gaps their viewers experience and how they address them.

These users are often interested in data-centric tasks, such as spreadsheet manipulation and data wrangling, which are hard to solve if the intent is only communicated using a natural-language description, without including the data. But how do we decide how much data and which data to include in the prompt? This paper makes two contributions towards answering this question. First, we create a dataset of real-world NL-to-code tasks manipulating tabular data, mined from StackOverflow posts. Second, we introduce a cluster-then-select prompting technique, which adds the most representative rows from the input data to the LLM prompt. Our experiments show that LLM performance is indeed sensitive to the amount of data passed in the prompt, and that for tasks with a lot of syntactic variation in the input table, our cluster-then-select technique outperforms a random selection baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u5230\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b-\u7136\u540e-\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u5728\u53d6\u4ee3\u50cfStackOverflow\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bba\u575b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u548c\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\uff09\u5f88\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ec5\u51ed\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f88\u96be\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u3002\u95ee\u9898\u662f\uff1a\u5e94\u8be5\u5305\u542b\u591a\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u53ca\u54ea\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\uff1f", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eceStackOverflow\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u51fa\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u805a\u7c7b-\u7136\u540e-\u9009\u62e9\u201d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u884c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230LLM\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u786e\u5b9e\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u654f\u611f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u8bed\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u805a\u7c7b-\u7136\u540e-\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cLLM\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u805a\u7c7b-\u7136\u540e-\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, crowdsourced labeling is time consuming and expensive. To address the concerns of effort and tedium, we designed CAL, a novel interface to aid in data labeling. We made several key design decisions for CAL, which include preventing inapt labels from being selected, guiding users in selecting an appropriate label when they need assistance, incorporating labeling documentation into the interface, and providing an efficient means to view previous labels. We implemented a production-quality implementation of CAL and report a user-study evaluation that compares CAL to a standard spreadsheet. Key findings of our study include users using CAL reported lower cognitive load, did not increase task time, users rated CAL to be easier to use, and users preferred CAL over the spreadsheet.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a CAL \u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f17\u5305\u6807\u6ce8\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cCAL \u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u589e\u52a0\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u66f4\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6b63\u786e\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4f17\u5305\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a CAL \u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u9632\u6b62\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u5f53\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u7528\u6237\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u5c06\u6807\u6ce8\u6587\u6863\u6574\u5408\u5230\u754c\u9762\u4e2d\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u770b\u5386\u53f2\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u5c06 CAL \u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u4f7f\u7528 CAL \u65f6\u62a5\u544a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u4e3a CAL \u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u559c\u6b22 CAL \u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u3002", "conclusion": "CAL \u754c\u9762\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

The flexible layout and novel generative functions enable experimentation with user-defined workflows. Two studies, a preliminary lab study and a longitudinal study with five expert artists, revealed a set of strategies participants use to tackle the challenges of TTI design space exploration, and the interface features required to support them - like using text-generation to define local \"axes\" of exploration.

However, crafting formulas on spreadsheets remains a tedious and error-prone task for many end-users, particularly when dealing with complex operations. To alleviate the burden associated with writing spreadsheet formulas, this paper introduces a novel benchmark task called NL2Formula, with the aim to generate executable formulas that are grounded on a spreadsheet table, given a Natural Language (NL) query as input. To accomplish this, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of 70,799 paired NL queries and corresponding spreadsheet formulas, covering 21,670 tables and 37 types of formula functions. We realize the NL2Formula task by providing a sequence-to-sequence baseline implementation called fCoder. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of fCoder, demonstrating its superior performance compared to the baseline models. Furthermore, we also compare fCoder with an initial GPT-3.5 model (i.e., text-davinci-003).

This version email address update", "summary": "Spreadsheets offer a supremely successful and intuitive means of processing and exchanging numerical content. Its intuitive ad-hoc nature makes it hugely popular for use in diverse areas including business and engineering, yet these very same characteristics make it extraordinarily error-prone; many would question whether it is suitable for serious analysis or modelling tasks. A previous EuSpRIG paper examined the role of Names in increasing solution transparency and providing a readable notation to forge links with the problem domain. Extensive use was made of CSE array formulas, but it is acknowledged that their use makes spreadsheet development a distinctly cumbersome task. Since that time, the new dynamic arrays have been introduced and array calculation is now the default mode of operation for Excel. This paper examines the thesis that their adoption within a more professional development environment could replace traditional techniques where solution integrity is important.

The decision involves choosing the right hardware and configuring a suitable set of parameters. However, comparing different accelerator design alternatives remains a complex task. Often, engineers rely on data sheets, spreadsheet calculations, or slow black-box simulators, which only offer a coarse understanding of the performance characteristics.\n  The Abstract Computer Architecture Description Language (ACADL) is a concise formalization of computer architecture block diagrams, which helps to communicate computer architecture on different abstraction levels and allows for inferring performance characteristics.

When humans use these tools in a human cog ensemble, the cognitive ability of the human is augmented.

Using large language models for formula authoring assistance in these environments can be difficult, as these models are expensive to train and challenging to deploy due to their size (up to billions of parameters). We present FLAME, a transformer-based model trained exclusively on Excel formulas that leverages domain insights to achieve competitive performance while being substantially smaller (60M parameters) and training on two orders of magnitude less data. We curate a training dataset using sketch deduplication, introduce an Excel-specific formula tokenizer, and use domain-specific versions of masked span prediction and noisy auto-encoding as pre-training objectives. We evaluate FLAME on formula repair, formula completion, and similarity-based formula retrieval.

Various tools have been developed to address these limitations, but they suffer from their own shortcomings, such as steep learning curves and limited customization. In this paper, we describe an end-to-end approach that supports spreadsheet-based entry of metadata while providing rigorous compliance and quality control. Our approach employs several key strategies, including customizable templates for defining metadata, integral support for the use of controlled terminologies when defining these templates, and an interactive Web-based tool that allows users to rapidly identify and fix errors in the spreadsheet-based metadata they supply.

Spreadsheet software allows users to automatically format their tables by writing data-dependent conditional formatting (CF) rules. Writing such rules is often challenging for users as it requires them to understand and implement the underlying logic. We present FormaT5, a transformer-based model that can generate a CF rule given the target table and a natural language description of the desired formatting logic. We find that user descriptions for these tasks are often under-specified or ambiguous, making it harder for code generation systems to accurately learn the desired rule in a single step. To tackle this problem of under-specification and minimise argument errors, FormaT5 learns to predict placeholders though an abstention objective. These placeholders can then be filled by a second model or, when examples of rows that should be formatted are available, by a programming-by-example system. To evaluate FormaT5 on diverse and real scenarios, we create an extensive benchmark of 1053 CF tasks, containing real-world descriptions collected from four different sources. We release our benchmarks to encourage research in this area. Abstention and filling allow FormaT5 to outperform 8 different neural approaches on our benchmarks, both with and without examples. Our results illustrate the value of building domain-specific learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unexpected Error", "motivation": "Error code: 503 - [{'error': {'code': 503, 'message': 'The model is overloaded.

Recent research on Knowledge Graph construction proposes the design of a fa\u00e7ade, a notion borrowed from object-oriented software engineering. This idea is applied to SPARQL Anything, a system that allows querying heterogeneous resources as-if they were in RDF, in plain SPARQL 1.1, by overloading the SERVICE clause. SPARQL Anything supports a wide variety of file formats, from popular ones (CSV, JSON, XML, Spreadsheets) to others that are not supported by alternative solutions (Markdown, YAML, DOCx, Bibtex). Features include querying Web APIs with high flexibility, parametrised queries, and chaining multiple transformations into complex pipelines. In this paper, we describe the design rationale and software architecture of the SPARQL Anything system. We provide references to an extensive set of reusable, real-world scenarios from various application domains.

This work investigates whether LLMs can generate code (Excel OfficeScripts, a TypeScript API for executing many tasks in Excel) that solves Excel specific tasks provided via natural language user instructions. To do so we introduce a new large-scale benchmark, InstructExcel, created by leveraging the 'Automate' feature in Excel to automatically generate OfficeScripts from users' actions. Our benchmark includes over 10k samples covering 170+ Excel operations across 2,000 publicly available Excel spreadsheets. Experiments across various zero-shot and few-shot settings show that InstructExcel is a hard benchmark for state of the art models like GPT-4.

To take the students' learning level into account, we have developed feedback levels for an ITS that provide gradually more information about the error by using one of the different analyses.

Dilger"], "categories": ["math.HO", "cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Wordle is a popular, online word game offered by the New York Times (nytimes.com). Currently there are some 2 million players of the English version worldwide. Players have 6 attempts to guess the daily word (target word) and after each attempt, the player receives color-coded information about the correctness and position of each letter in the guess. After either a successful completion of the puzzle or the final unsuccessful attempt, software can assess the player's luck and skill using Information Theory and can display data for the first, second, ..., sixth guesses of a random sample of all players. Recently, I discovered that the latter data is presented in a format that can easily be copied and pasted into a spreadsheet. I compiled data on Wordle players' first guesses from May 2023 - August 2023 and inferred some interesting information about Wordle players. A) Every day, about 0.2-0.5% of players solve the puzzle in one attempt. Because the odds of guessing the one of 2,315 possible target words at random is 0.043%, this implies that 4,000 - 10,000 players cheat by obtaining the target word outside of playing the game! B) At least 1/3 of the players have a favorite starting word, or cycle through several. And even though players should be aware that target words are never repeated, most players appear to remain loyal to their starting word even after its appearance as a target word. C) On August 15, 2023, about 30,000 players abruptly changed their starting word, presumably based on a crossword puzzle clue! Wordle players can be influenced!

Still, as LLMs (and other generative models) generate more complex output, such as summaries, tables, or code, it becomes harder for the user to audit or evaluate the output for quality or correctness. Hence, we are seeing the emergence of tool-assisted experiences to help the user double-check a piece of AI-generated content. We refer to these as co-audit tools. Co-audit tools complement prompt engineering techniques: one helps the user construct the input prompt, while the other helps them check the output response. As a specific example, this paper describes recent research on co-audit tools for spreadsheet computations powered by generative models. We explain why co-audit experiences are essential for any application of generative AI where quality is important and errors are consequential (as is common in spreadsheet computations). We propose a preliminary list of principles for co-audit, and outline research challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u6838\u9a8c\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u201c\u534f\u540c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u201d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u68c0\u67e5AI\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u534f\u540c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u539f\u5219\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6216\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728AI\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u9519\u8bef\u540e\u679c\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u534f\u540c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u7531\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u6838\u67e5AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8865\u5145\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u534f\u540c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u539f\u5219\u5217\u8868\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u534f\u540c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4f53\u9a8c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u4e14\u9519\u8bef\u540e\u679c\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff09\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

To reach the level where computational thinking skills, especially digital problem solving have their own schemata, there is a long way to go. In the present paper, a novel approach is detailed to support subject integration and building digital schemata, on the well-known Beaufort scale. The conversion of a traditional, paper-based problem and a data retrieval process are presented within the frame of a Grade 8 action research study. It is found that both students content knowledge and their digital skills developed more efficiently than in traditional course book and decontextualized digital environments. Furthermore, the method presented here can be adapted to any paper-based problems whose solutions would be more effective in a digital environment and which offer various forms for building schemata both in the subject matter and informatics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u516b\u5e74\u7ea7\u884c\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u84b2\u798f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6765\u6574\u5408\u5b66\u79d1\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b57\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u5f0f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57f9\u517b\u5b66\u751f\u5185\u5bb9\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6280\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u53ef\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u7eb8\u8d28\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u601d\u7ef4\u5e94\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0e\u9605\u8bfb\u3001\u5199\u4f5c\u548c\u7b97\u672f\u5e76\u5217\u7684\u7b2c\u56db\u9879\u57fa\u672c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u57f9\u517b\u6570\u5b57\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u56fe\u5f0f\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u8457\u540d\u7684\u84b2\u798f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6765\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u79d1\u6574\u5408\u548c\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u516b\u5e74\u7ea7\u884c\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7eb8\u8d28\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6570\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u5c55\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u6bd4\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u6559\u6750\u548c\u53bb\u8bed\u5883\u5316\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b66\u79d1\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5c06\u5176\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u73af\u5883\u4f1a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7eb8\u8d28\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5b66\u79d1\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002"}}

It considers both the use case that a spreadsheet is meant to serve, and the engineering resources devoted to its development. We extend a previous three-type taxonomy, to identify nine types of spreadsheet models, that encompass the many analytical spreadsheet models seen in the literature. We connect disparate research literature to distinguish between an \"analytical solution\" and an \"industrial-quality analytical spreadsheet model\". We explore the nature of each of the nine types, propose definitions for some, relate them to the literature, and hypothesize on how they might arise. The taxonomy aids in identifying where various spreadsheet development guidelines are most useful, provides a lens for viewing spreadsheet errors and risk, and offers a structure for understanding how spreadsheets change over time. This taxonomy opens the door to many interesting research questions, including refinements to itself.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u578b\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u7c7b\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e5d\u4e2a\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u201c\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u201d\u548c\u201c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u578b\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u89e3\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8003\u8651\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u7528\u4f8b\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u5bf9\u5206\u6790\u578b\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5e76\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u732e\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u65e8\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u67e5\u770b\u9519\u8bef/\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u89e3\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e5d\u79cd\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\u5b83\u8fde\u63a5\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u201c\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u201d\u548c\u201c\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u578b\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u201d\u3002\u5b83\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6bcf\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u6587\u732e\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4ea7\u751f\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e5d\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u578b\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5f00\u53d1\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c2\u5bdf\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u89e3\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Some of the most important datasets are found in biomedical and financial domains in the form of spreadsheets and relational databases. But this tabular data is often sensitive in nature. Synthetic data generation offers the potential to unlock sensitive data, but generative models tend to memorise and regurgitate training data, which undermines the privacy goal. To remedy this, researchers have incorporated the mathematical framework of Differential Privacy (DP) into the training process of deep neural networks. But this creates a trade-off between the quality and privacy of the resulting data. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are the dominant paradigm for synthesising tabular data under DP, but suffer from unstable adversarial training and mode collapse, which are exacerbated by the privacy constraints and challenging tabular data modality. This work optimises the quality-privacy trade-off of generative models, producing higher quality tabular datasets with the same privacy guarantees. We implement novel end-to-end models that leverage attention mechanisms to learn reversible tabular representations. We also introduce TableDiffusion, the first differentially-private diffusion model for tabular data synthesis. Our experiments show that TableDiffusion produces higher-fidelity synthetic datasets, avoids the mode collapse problem, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on privatised tabular data synthesis. By implementing TableDiffusion to predict the added noise, we enabled it to bypass the challenges of reconstructing mixed-type tabular data. Overall, the diffusion paradigm proves vastly more data and privacy efficient than the adversarial paradigm, due to augmented re-use of each data batch and a smoother iterative training process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faTableDiffusion\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8d28\u91cf-\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eGAN\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u8981\u5408\u6210\u4ee5\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DP-GANs\uff09\u5728\u5408\u6210\u654f\u611f\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8d28\u91cf-\u9690\u79c1\u6743\u8861\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9006\u8868\u683c\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86TableDiffusion\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002TableDiffusion\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6dfb\u52a0\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u7ed5\u8fc7\u91cd\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "TableDiffusion\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8fdc\u8fdc\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u5f0f\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u8303\u5f0f\uff08TableDiffusion\uff09\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u5bf9\u6297\u5f0f\u8303\u5f0f\uff08GANs\uff09\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6548\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Systems that successfully clean such string data can have a significant impact on real users. While prior work has explored errors in string data, proposed approaches have often been limited to error detection or require that the user provide annotations, examples, or constraints to fix the errors. Furthermore, these systems have focused independently on syntactic errors or semantic errors in strings, but ignore that strings often contain both syntactic and semantic substrings. We introduce DataVinci, a fully unsupervised string data error detection and repair system. DataVinci learns regular-expression-based patterns that cover a majority of values in a column and reports values that do not satisfy such patterns as data errors. DataVinci can automatically derive edits to the data error based on the majority patterns and constraints learned over other columns without the need for further user interaction. To handle strings with both syntactic and semantic substrings, DataVinci uses an LLM to abstract (and re-concretize) portions of strings that are semantic prior to learning majority patterns and deriving edits. Because not all data can result in majority patterns, DataVinci leverages execution information from an existing program (which reads the target data) to identify and correct data repairs that would not otherwise be identified.

However, such a standard cannot be taken for granted when dealing with tables \"in the wild\". Our survey of real spreadsheet-tables and web-tables shows that over 30% of such tables do not conform to the relational standard, for which complex table-restructuring transformations are needed before these tables can be queried easily using SQL-based analytics tools. Unfortunately, the required transformations are non-trivial to program, which has become a substantial pain point for technical and non-technical users alike, as evidenced by large numbers of forum questions in places like StackOverflow and Excel/Power-BI/Tableau forums.\n  We develop an Auto-Tables system that can automatically synthesize pipelines with multi-step transformations (in Python or other languages), to transform non-relational tables into standard relational forms for downstream analytics, obviating the need for users to manually program transformations. We compile an extensive benchmark for this new task, by collecting 244 real test cases from user spreadsheets and online forums. Our evaluation suggests that Auto-Tables can successfully synthesize transformations for over 70% of test cases at interactive speeds, without requiring any input from users, making this an effective tool for both technical and non-technical users to prepare data for analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aAuto-Tables\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u975e\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u8868\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u8868\u683c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8fdb\u884cSQL\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u5728\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u75db\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc730%\u7684\u8868\u683c\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u683c\uff09\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eSQL\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u67e5\u8be2\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u683c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8868\u683c\u91cd\u6784\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u800c\u624b\u52a8\u7f16\u7a0b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f6c\u6362\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u548c\u975e\u6280\u672f\u7528\u6237\u6765\u8bf4\u90fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aAuto-Tables\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8f6c\u6362\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u4f7f\u7528Python\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u975e\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u8868\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u6536\u96c6\u4e86244\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u7528\u6237\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8bba\u575b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "Auto-Tables\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u5730\u4e3a\u8d85\u8fc770%\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u5408\u6210\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "conclusion": "Auto-Tables\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6280\u672f\u548c\u975e\u6280\u672f\u7528\u6237\u51c6\u5907\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u975e\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u8868\u683c\u5230\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u8868\u683c\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u75db\u70b9\u3002"}}

A catenary shape is simply the natural shape of a rope, chain, or drill string. The drill string will then hang freely inside the wellbore. Perfectly, there should be no contact between the hole and the string, and thus no friction. Torque and drag should be minimized this way. A case study is introduced to examine the outcome between Catenary Trajectory Design and traditional 2D Arc design.

The complexity of these systems coupled with our high dependency on them implies both a non-negligible likelihood of system failures, and a high potential that such failures have significant negative effects on our everyday life. For that reason, it is a vital requirement to keep the harm of emerging failures to a minimum, which means minimizing the system downtime as well as the cost of system repair. This is where model-based diagnosis comes into play.\n  Model-based diagnosis is a principled, domain-independent approach that can be generally applied to troubleshoot systems of a wide variety of types, including all the ones mentioned above, and many more. It exploits and orchestrates i.a. techniques for knowledge representation, automated reasoning, heuristic problem solving, intelligent search, optimization, stochastics, statistics, decision making under uncertainty, machine learning, as well as calculus, combinatorics and set theory to detect, localize, and fix faults in abnormally behaving systems.\n  In this thesis, we will give an introduction to the topic of model-based diagnosis, point out the major challenges in the field, and discuss a selection of approaches from our research addressing these issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u662f\u5e94\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6545\u969c\u9020\u6210\u7684\u635f\u5bb3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u4e16\u754c\u5bf9\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u589e\u5927\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u6545\u969c\u635f\u5bb3\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u505c\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7ef4\u4fee\u6210\u672c\uff09\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u7406\u3001\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u968f\u673a\u5b66\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u53ca\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u548c\u96c6\u5408\u8bba\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6545\u969c\u3002\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u4ecb\u7ecd\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u3001\u6307\u51fa\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u672a\u7ed9\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5c06\u4ecb\u7ecd\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u4e3b\u9898\u3001\u6307\u51fa\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4f5c\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\u662f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u6311\u6218\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, only a small portion of the infinite space of naturalistic utterances is effective at guiding code generation. For non-expert end-user programmers, learning this is the challenge of abstraction matching. We examine this challenge in the specific context of data analysis in spreadsheets, in a system that maps the users natural language query to Python code using the Codex generator, executes the code, and shows the result. We propose grounded abstraction matching, which bridges the abstraction gap by translating the code back into a systematic and predictable naturalistic utterance. In a between-subjects, think-aloud study (n=24), we compare grounded abstraction matching to an ungrounded alternative based on previously established query framing principles.

Since SAM requires less data than cluster analysis, it is also able to generate a real time picture of how shelter access patterns are affected by external factors. Timelines generated from nine years of shelter client data using SAM demonstrate the impact of Housing First programming and the COVID-19 lockdown on how people access shelter.

The ensuing dependencies are tracked as formula graphs. Efficiently querying and maintaining these formula graphs is critical for interactivity across multiple settings. Unfortunately, formula graphs are often large and complex such that querying and maintaining them is time-consuming, reducing interactivity. We propose TACO, a framework for efficiently compressing formula graphs, thereby reducing the time for querying and maintenance. The efficiency of TACO stems from a key spreadsheet property: tabular locality, which means that cells close to each other are likely to have similar formula structures. We leverage four such tabular locality-based patterns and develop algorithms for compressing formula graphs using these patterns, directly querying the compressed graph without decompression, and incrementally maintaining the graph during updates. We integrate TACO into an open-source spreadsheet system and show that TACO can significantly reduce formula graph sizes.

Stylistic formatting of these tables is an important property for both presentation and analysis. As a result, popular spreadsheet software, such as Excel, supports automatically formatting tables based on rules. Unfortunately, writing such formatting rules can be challenging for users as it requires knowledge of the underlying rule language and data logic. We present CORNET, a system that tackles the novel problem of automatically learning such formatting rules from user examples in the form of formatted cells. CORNET takes inspiration from advances in inductive programming and combines symbolic rule enumeration with a neural ranker to learn conditional formatting rules. To motivate and evaluate our approach, we extracted tables with over 450K unique formatting rules from a corpus of over 1.8M real worksheets. Since we are the first to introduce conditional formatting, we compare CORNET to a wide range of symbolic and neural baselines adapted from related domains. Our results show that CORNET accurately learns rules across varying evaluation setups.

In industry, there is an abundance of tables found in spreadsheets, but acquisition of substantial amounts of labels is expensive, since only experts can annotate the often highly technical and domain-specific tables. Active learning could potentially reduce labeling costs, however, so far there are no works related to active learning in conjunction with tabular language models. In this paper we investigate different acquisition functions in a real-world industrial tabular language model use case for sub-cell named entity recognition.

TABT5 achieves new state-of-the-art results on several domains, including spreadsheet formula prediction with a 15% increase in sequence accuracy, QA with a 2.5% increase in sequence accuracy and data-to-text generation with a 2.5% increase in BLEU.", "AI": {"tldr": "TABT5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u8868\u683c\u7279\u5b9a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u516c\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u5668Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5355\u5143\u683c\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u8574\u6db5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TABT5\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8868\u683c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "TABT5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u516c\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8615%\uff0c\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.5%\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684BLEU\u503c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e862.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "TABT5\u901a\u8fc7\u514b\u670d\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We draw upon publicly available experience reports of LLM-assisted programming, as well as prior usability and design studies. We find that while LLM-assisted programming shares some properties of compilation, pair programming, and programming via search and reuse, there are fundamental differences both in the technical possibilities as well as the practical experience. Thus, LLM-assisted programming ought to be viewed as a new way of programming with its own distinct properties and challenges.\n  Finally, we draw upon observations from a user study in which non-expert end user programmers use LLM-assisted tools for solving data tasks in spreadsheets. We discuss the issues that might arise, and open research challenges, in applying large language models to end-user programming, particularly with users who have little or no programming expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f85\u52a9\u7f16\u7a0b\u6b63\u5728\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7528\u6237\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u7a0b\u8f85\u52a9\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5f02\u540c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u5f0f\uff1b\u8ba8\u8bba\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f88\u5c11\u6216\u6ca1\u6709\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7684\uff09\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u501f\u9274\u4e86\u516c\u5f00\u7684LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7f16\u7a0b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u5148\u524d\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u9879\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8ba9\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7f16\u8bd1\u3001\u7ed3\u5bf9\u7f16\u7a0b\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7a0b\u5171\u4eab\u4e00\u4e9b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5b83\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u81ea\u8eab\u72ec\u7279\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u6311\u6218\u7684\u65b0\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u7f16\u7a0b\u65f6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f88\u5c11\u6216\u6ca1\u6709\u7684\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5404\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7f16\u7a0b\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Although tabular data is omnipresent in industry, applications of table transformers are still missing. In this paper, we study how these models can be applied to an industrial Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem where the entities are mentioned in tabular-structured spreadsheets. The highly technical nature of spreadsheets as well as the lack of labeled data present major challenges for fine-tuning transformer-based models. Therefore, we develop a dedicated table data augmentation strategy based on available domain-specific knowledge graphs. We show that this boosts performance in our low-resource scenario considerably. Further, we investigate the benefits of tabular structure as inductive bias compared to tables as linearized sequences. Our experiments confirm that a table transformer outperforms other baselines and that its tabular inductive bias is vital for convergence of transformer-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\uff08NER\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u548c\u6280\u672f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u65e0\u5904\u4e0d\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u8868\u683c Transformer \u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u7136\u7f3a\u5931\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4e1a\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\uff08NER\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f53\u5728\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53ca\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u4e0e\u8868\u683c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u76f8\u6bd4\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8868\u683c Transformer \u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8868\u683c\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Currently, hazard analysis is mainly based on human reasoning, past experiences, and simple tools such as checklists and spreadsheets. Increasing system complexity makes such approaches decreasingly suitable. Furthermore, testing-based hazard analysis is often not suitable due to high costs or dangers of physical faults. A remedy for this are model-based hazard analysis methods, which either rely on formal models or on simulation models, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. This paper proposes a two-layer approach that combines the benefits of exhaustive analysis using formal methods with detailed analysis using simulation.

In the meantime, one of us in PL had impulsively launched an unofficial long-term mentoring program, founded on chaos and spreadsheets. In January 2021, the latter grew to an official cross-institutional long-term mentoring program called SIGPLAN-M; in January 2022, the former grew to Computer Architecture Long-term Mentoring (CALM).\n  The impacts have been strong: SIGPLAN-M reaches 328 mentees and 234 mentors across 41 countries, and mentees have described it as \"life changing\" and \"a career saver.\" And while CALM is in its pilot phase -- with 13 mentors and 21 mentees across 7 countries -- it has received very positive feedback. The leaders of SIGPLAN-M and CALM shared our designs, impacts, and challenges along the way. Now, we wish to share those with you.

However, creating such metaphoric glyph-based visualization (MGV) is not an easy task, as it requires not only a deep understanding of data but also professional design skills. This paper proposes MetaGlyph, an automatic system for generating MGVs from a spreadsheet. To develop MetaGlyph, we first conduct a qualitative analysis to understand the design of current MGVs from the perspectives of metaphor embodiment and glyph design. Based on the results, we introduce a novel framework for generating MGVs by metaphoric image selection and an MGV construction. Specifically, MetaGlyph automatically selects metaphors with corresponding images from online resources based on the input data semantics. We then integrate a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the design of an MGV by associating visual elements with data dimensions given the data importance, semantic relevance, and glyph non-overlap. The system also provides editing feedback that allows users to customize the MGVs according to their design preferences. We demonstrate the use of MetaGlyph through a set of examples, one usage scenario, and validate its effectiveness through a series of expert interviews.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMetaGlyph\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u55bb\u5b57\u5f62\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff08MGV\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u4ece\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbf\u8c08\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u521b\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u55bb\u7684\u5b57\u5f62\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff08MGV\uff09\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f53\u524dMGV\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u9690\u55bb\u4f53\u73b0\u548c\u5b57\u5f62\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u55bb\u56fe\u50cf\u9009\u62e9\u548cMGV\u6784\u5efa\u6765\u751f\u6210MGV\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0cMetaGlyph\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u5728\u7ebf\u8d44\u6e90\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5e26\u6709\u76f8\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u9690\u55bb\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5b57\u5f62\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u7684MGV\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f16\u8f91\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u6839\u636e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u504f\u597d\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49MGV\u3002", "result": "MetaGlyph\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210MGV\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7ec4\u793a\u4f8b\u3001\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u6f14\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bbf\u8c08\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u6839\u636e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u504f\u597d\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49MGV\u3002"}}

While these domains are generic, they may only barely overlap. For example, visual-language models (VLMs) are trained on Internet-scale image captions, but large language models (LMs) are further trained on Internet-scale text with no images (e.g., spreadsheets, SAT questions, code). As a result, these models store different forms of commonsense knowledge across different domains. In this work, we show that this diversity is symbiotic, and can be leveraged through Socratic Models (SMs): a modular framework in which multiple pretrained models may be composed zero-shot i.e., via multimodal-informed prompting, to exchange information with each other and capture new multimodal capabilities, without requiring finetuning. With minimal engineering, SMs are not only competitive with state-of-the-art zero-shot image captioning and video-to-text retrieval, but also enable new applications such as (i) answering free-form questions about egocentric video, (ii) engaging in multimodal assistive dialogue with people (e.g., for cooking recipes) by interfacing with external APIs and databases (e.g., web search), and (iii) robot perception and planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Socratic Models (SMs)\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u7740\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "Socratic Models (SMs) \u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b83\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u76f8\u4e92\u4ea4\u6362\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "Socratic Models (SMs) \u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5b57\u5e55\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u4eec\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u56de\u7b54\u5173\u4e8e\u4ee5\u81ea\u6211\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f85\u52a9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4ee5\u53ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u5171\u751f\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7Socratic Models\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002"}}

Since spreadsheet systems have limited capabilities, users often need to load spreadsheets to other data science environments to perform advanced analytics. However, current approaches for spreadsheet loading suffer from either high runtime or memory usage, which hinders data exploration on commodity systems. To make spreasheet loading practical on commodity systems, we introduce a novel parser that minimizes memory usage by tightly coupling decompression and parsing.

The spreadsheet application's ease of use and usefulness has enabled non-programmers to perform programming-like tasks in a familiar setting modeled after the tabular \"pen and paper\" approach.

This thesis demonstrates an extension of the spreadsheet computing paradigm in overcoming this limitation to solve constraint satisfaction problems. We present a framework seamlessly incorporating a finite constraint solver with the spreadsheet computing paradigm. This framework allows the individual cells in the spreadsheet to be attached to either a finite domain or a constraint specifying the relationship among the cells. The framework provides an interface for constraint solving and further enhances the spreadsheet computing paradigm by providing a set of spreadsheet-specific constraints that will aid in controlling the scalability of large spreadsheet applications implementations.

Existing deep learning methods for question answering on tabular data have various limitations, such as having to feed the entire table as input into a neural network model, making them unsuitable for most real-world applications. Since real-world data might contain millions of rows, it may not entirely fit into the memory. Moreover, data could be stored in live databases, which are updated in real-time, and it is impractical to serialize an entire database to a neural network-friendly format each time it is updated. In TableQuery, we use deep learning models pre-trained for question answering on free text to convert natural language queries to structured queries, which can be run against a database or a spreadsheet. This method eliminates the need for fitting the entire data into memory as well as serializing databases. Furthermore, deep learning models pre-trained for question answering on free text are readily available on platforms such as HuggingFace Model Hub (7). TableQuery does not require re-training; when a newly trained model for question answering with better performance is available, it can replace the existing model in TableQuery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unexpected Error", "motivation": "Error code: 503 - [{'error': {'code': 503, 'message': 'The model is overloaded.

Previous research on supporting VR knowledge work explored domains such as text entry using physical keyboards and spreadsheet interaction using combined pen and touch input. Inspired by such work, this paper probes the VR design space for authoring presentations in mobile settings. We propose PoVRPoint -- a set of tools coupling pen- and touch-based editing of presentations on mobile devices, such as tablets, with the interaction capabilities afforded by VR. We study the utility of extended display space to, for example, assist users in identifying target slides, supporting spatial manipulation of objects on a slide, creating animations, and facilitating arrangements of multiple, possibly occluded, shapes. Among other things, our results indicate that 1) the wide field of view afforded by VR results in significantly faster target slide identification times compared to a tablet-only interface for visually salient targets; and 2) the three-dimensional view in VR enables significantly faster object reordering in the presence of occlusion compared to two baseline interfaces. A user study further confirmed that the interaction techniques were found to be usable and enjoyable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unexpected Error", "motivation": "Error code: 503 - [{'error': {'code': 503, 'message': 'The model is overloaded.

There exist now different approaches to store tabular data physically. PDFs, images, spreadsheets, and CSVs are leading examples. Being able to parse table structures and extract content bounded by these structures is of high importance in many applications. In this paper, we devise TableParser, a system capable of parsing tables in both native PDFs and scanned images with high precision.

To answer these questions, our methodology prescribes the following steps: i) Identify the domain; ii) Identify a list of candidate software packages; iii) Filter the list to a length of about 30 packages; iv) Gather source code and documentation for each package; v) Collect repository related data on each software package, like number of stars, number of open issues, number of lines of code; vi) Fill in the measurement template (the template consists of 108 questions to assess 9 qualities (including the qualities of installability, usability and visibility)); vii) Interview developers (the interview consists of 20 questions and takes about an hour); viii) Rank the software using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP); and, ix) Analyze the data to answer the questions posed above. A domain expert should be engaged throughout the process, to ensure that implicit information about the domain is properly represented and to assist with conducting an analysis of the commonalities and variabilities between the 30 selected packages.

Examples include Smalltalk, LISP, HyperCard, Flash, and spreadsheets. Image-based programming avoids much of the complexity of modern programming technology stacks and encourages more casual and exploratory programming. However conventional file-based programming has better support for collaboration and deployment. These problems have been blamed for the limited commercial success of Smalltalk. We propose to enable collaboration in image-based programming via types and structure editing.\n  We focus on the problem of schema change on persistent data. We turn to static types, which paradoxically require more schema change but also provide a mechanism to express and execute those changes. To determine those changes we turn to structure editing, so that we can capture changes in type definitions with sufficient fidelity to automatically adapt the data to suit. We conjecture that typical schema changes can be handled through structure editing of static types.\n  That positions us to tackle collaboration with what could be called version control for structure editing. We present a theory realizing this idea, which is our main technical contribution. While we focus here on editing types, if we can extend the approach to cover the entire programming experience then it would offer a new way to collaborate in image-based programming.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u955c\u50cf\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u66f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u955c\u50cf\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982Smalltalk\u3001LISP\uff09\u867d\u7136\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u9762\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5546\u4e1a\u6210\u529f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9759\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u8f91\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u955c\u50cf\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u66f4\u3002\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u7c7b\u578b\u6765\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d8\u66f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u8f91\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u7c7b\u578b\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u8f91\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u201d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u6280\u672f\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u7ed3\u6784\u7f16\u8f91\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u201d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5982\u679c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u7f16\u7a0b\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u955c\u50cf\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Their widespread employment makes it easy to gather large collections of data, but their flexible canvas-based structure makes automated analysis difficult without heavy preparation. One of the common problems that practitioners face is the presence of multiple, independent regions in a single spreadsheet, possibly separated by repeated empty cells. We define such files as \"multiregion\" files. In collections of various spreadsheets, we can observe that some share the same layout. We present the Mondrian approach to automatically identify layout templates across multiple files and systematically extract the corresponding regions. Our approach is composed of three phases: first, each file is rendered as an image and inspected for elements that could form regions; then, using a clustering algorithm, the identified elements are grouped to form regions; finally, every file layout is represented as a graph and compared with others to find layout templates. We compare our method to state-of-the-art table recognition algorithms on two corpora of real-world enterprise spreadsheets. Our approach shows the best performances in detecting reliable region boundaries within each file and can correctly identify recurring layouts across files.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mondrian\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u533a\u57df\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u56e0\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u867d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u591a\u533a\u57df\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u51c6\u5907\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "Mondrian\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u6587\u4ef6\u6e32\u67d3\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u6f5c\u5728\u533a\u57df\u5143\u7d20\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u5143\u7d20\u5206\u7ec4\u5f62\u6210\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u5e03\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u56fe\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u5e03\u5c40\u6a21\u677f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6587\u4ef6\u5185\u53ef\u9760\u533a\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u590d\u5e03\u5c40\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "Mondrian\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u533a\u57df\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u5e03\u5c40\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

Limited network access and software security requirements prevent the usage of standard cloud based microservice analytic platforms that are typically used in industry. One solution is to precompute a wide range of analytics as files that can be used with standard preinstalled software that does not require network access or additional software and can run on a wide range of legacy hardware. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this approach was tested for providing geo-spatial census data to allow quick analysis of demographic data for better responding to emergencies. These data were processed using the MIT SuperCloud to create several thousand Google Earth and Microsoft Excel files representative of many advanced analytics. The fast mapping of census data using Google Earth and Microsoft Excel has the potential to give emergency responders a powerful tool to improve emergency preparedness. Our approach displays relevant census data (total population, population under 15, population over 65, median age) per census block, sorted by county, through a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (xlsx file) and Google Earth map (kml file).

To support historians to cope with these problems, in this paper we describe the Synthesis documentation system and its use by a large number of historians in the context of an ongoing research project in the field of History of Art.

Recent attempts on table understanding mainly focus on relational tables, yet overlook to other common table structures. In this paper, we propose TUTA, a unified pre-training architecture for understanding generally structured tables. Noticing that understanding a table requires spatial, hierarchical, and semantic information, we enhance transformers with three novel structure-aware mechanisms. First, we devise a unified tree-based structure, called a bi-dimensional coordinate tree, to describe both the spatial and hierarchical information of generally structured tables. Upon this, we propose tree-based attention and position embedding to better capture the spatial and hierarchical information. Moreover, we devise three progressive pre-training objectives to enable representations at the token, cell, and table levels. We pre-train TUTA on a wide range of unlabeled web and spreadsheet tables and fine-tune it on two critical tasks in the field of table structure understanding: cell type classification and table type classification. Experiments show that TUTA is highly effective, achieving state-of-the-art on five widely-studied datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TUTA\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u8868\u683c\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u8868\u683c\u9700\u8981\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTUTA\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5750\u6807\u6811\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee4\u724c\u3001\u5355\u5143\u683c\u548c\u8868\u683c\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5728\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5355\u5143\u683c\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8868\u683c\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "TUTA\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "TUTA\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u901a\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

But for many people, spreadsheets -- the quintessential table tool -- remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers: people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and \"get their hands on\" the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking.

These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it.

However, to recommend commonly composed charts in real world, one should take the challenges of efficiency, imbalanced data and table context into consideration. In this paper, we propose Table2Charts framework which learns common patterns from a large corpus of (table, charts) pairs. Based on deep Q-learning with copying mechanism and heuristic searching, Table2Charts does table-to-sequence generation, where each sequence follows a chart template. On a large spreadsheet corpus with 165k tables and 266k charts, we show that Table2Charts could learn a shared representation of table fields so that recommendation tasks on different chart types could mutually enhance each other.

Previous works typically utilize input-output examples as the specification for spreadsheet formula synthesis, where each input-output pair simulates a separate row in the spreadsheet. However, this formulation does not fully capture the rich context in real-world spreadsheets. First, spreadsheet data entries are organized as tables, thus rows and columns are not necessarily independent from each other. In addition, many spreadsheet tables include headers, which provide high-level descriptions of the cell data. However, previous synthesis approaches do not consider headers as part of the specification. In this work, we present the first approach for synthesizing spreadsheet formulas from tabular context, which includes both headers and semi-structured tabular data. In particular, we propose SpreadsheetCoder, a BERT-based model architecture to represent the tabular context in both row-based and column-based formats.

Automatic table detection is a key enabling technique and an initial step in spreadsheet data intelligence. However, the detection task is challenged by the diversity of table structures and table layouts on the spreadsheet. Considering the analogy between a cell matrix as spreadsheet and a pixel matrix as image, and encouraged by the successful application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in computer vision, we have developed TableSense, a novel end-to-end framework for spreadsheet table detection. First, we devise an effective cell featurization scheme to better leverage the rich information in each cell; second, we develop an enhanced convolutional neural network model for table detection to meet the domain-specific requirement on precise table boundary detection; third, we propose an effective uncertainty metric to guide an active learning based smart sampling algorithm, which enables the efficient build-up of a training dataset with 22,176 tables on 10,220 sheets with broad coverage of diverse table structures and layouts. Our evaluation shows that TableSense is highly effective with 91.3\\% recall and 86.5\\% precision in EoB-2 metric, a significant improvement over both the current detection algorithm that are used in commodity spreadsheet tools and state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks in computer vision.", "AI": {"tldr": "TableSense\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8868\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5355\u5143\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u7684CNN\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8691.3%\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c86.5%\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u8868\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "TableSense\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u6709\u6548\u7684\u5355\u5143\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u30022. \u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8868\u683c\u8fb9\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u30023. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b22,176\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u548c10,220\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8868\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "TableSense\u5728EoB-2\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e3a91.3%\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u4e3a86.5%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5546\u54c1\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "TableSense\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8868\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

One of the critical problems in mining tabular data is how to understand their inherent semantic structures automatically. Existing studies typically adopt Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to model the spatial information of tabular structures yet ignore more diverse relational information between cells, such as the hierarchical and paratactic relationships. To simultaneously extract spatial and relational information from tables, we propose a novel neural network architecture, TabularNet. The spatial encoder of TabularNet utilizes the row/column-level Pooling and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) to capture statistical information and local positional correlation, respectively. For relational information, we design a new graph construction method based on the WordNet tree and adopt a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based encoder that focuses on the hierarchical and paratactic relationships between cells. Our neural network architecture can be a unified neural backbone for different understanding tasks and utilized in a multitask scenario. We conduct extensive experiments on three classification tasks with two real-world spreadsheet data sets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TabularNet over state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "TabularNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u6c60\u5316\u548cBi-GRU\uff09\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eWordNet\u6811\u7684\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u548cGCN\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u53d6\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5355\u5143\u683c\u4e4b\u95f4\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u5c42\u7ea7\u548c\u5e76\u5217\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u8868\u683c\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TabularNet\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5229\u7528\u884c/\u5217\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6c60\u5316\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff08Bi-GRU\uff09\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eWordNet\u6811\u7684\u65b0\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GCN\uff09\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5355\u5143\u683c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u548c\u5e76\u5217\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TabularNet\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TabularNet\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Spreadsheet software and relational database management systems are still the dominant tools for quantitative analysis and overall data management in these these sciences, allowing researchers to directly analyse the gathered data and perform scholarly interpretation. However, this current practice has a set of limitations, including the high dependency of the collected data on the initial research hypothesis, usually useless for other research, the lack of representation of the details from which the registered relations are inferred, and the difficulty to revisit the original data sources for verification, corrections or improvements. To cope with these problems, in this paper we present FAST CAT, a collaborative system for assistive data entry and curation in Digital Humanities and similar forms of empirical research. We describe the related challenges, the overall methodology we follow for supporting semantic interoperability, and discuss the use of FAST CAT in the context of a European (ERC) project of Maritime History, called SeaLiT, which examines economic, social and demographic impacts of the introduction of steamboats in the Mediterranean area between the 1850s and the 1920s.", "AI": {"tldr": "FAST CAT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u6587\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff09\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d77\u4e8b\u5386\u53f2\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u5b9e\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\uff08\u5982\u5386\u53f2\u5b66\uff09\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u505a\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6536\u96c6\u5230\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u521d\u59cb\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u7528\uff1b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u6240\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u96be\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u67e5\u9605\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u7ea0\u6b63\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FAST CAT\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u6587\u548c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u5f55\u5165\u548c\u6574\u7406\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86FAST CAT\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSeaLiT\u7684\u6b27\u6d32\uff08ERC\uff09\u6d77\u4e8b\u5386\u53f2\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u9879\u76ee\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a7619\u4e16\u7eaa50\u5e74\u4ee3\u81f320\u4e16\u7eaa20\u5e74\u4ee3\u5730\u4e2d\u6d77\u5730\u533a\u6c7d\u8239\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "FAST CAT\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u6587\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u8f85\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u5f55\u5165\u548c\u6574\u7406\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002"}}

The ability to directly access the warehouse data, interactively analyze and explore it at scale can empower users to improve their decision making cycles. However, existing tools for analyzing data in CDWs are either limited in ad-hoc transformations or difficult to use for business users, the largest user segment in enterprises. Here we introduce Sigma Worksheet, a new interactive system that enables users to easily perform ad-hoc visual analysis of data in CDWs at scale. For this, Sigma Worksheet provides an accessible spreadsheet-like interface for data analysis through direct manipulation. Sigma Worksheet dynamically constructs matching SQL queries from user interactions on this familiar interface, building on the versatility and expressivity of SQL. Sigma Worksheet executes constructed queries directly on CDWs, leveraging the superior characteristics of the new generation CDWs, including scalability. To evaluate Sigma Worksheet, we first demonstrate its expressivity through two real life use cases, cohort analysis and sessionization. We then measure the performance of the Worksheet generated queries with a set of experiments using the TPC-H benchmark. Results show the performance of our compiled SQL queries is comparable to that of the reference queries of the benchmark. Finally, to assess the usefulness of Sigma Worksheet in deployment, we elicit feedback through a 100-person survey followed by a semi-structured interview study with 70 participants. We find that Sigma Worksheet is easier to use and learn, improving the productivity of users. Our findings also suggest Sigma Worksheet can further improve user experience by providing guidance to users at various steps of data analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sigma Worksheet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u719f\u6089\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u754c\u9762\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efaSQL\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7528\u6237\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5373\u5e2d\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4ed3\u5e93\uff08CDWs\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5373\u5e2d\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u9762\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u5bf9\u4e1a\u52a1\u7528\u6237\u800c\u8a00\u96be\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u4e1a\u52a1\u7528\u6237\u662f\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6613\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "Sigma Worksheet\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efaSQL\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u7528\u4f8b\uff08\u7fa4\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5316\uff09\u3001TPC-H\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u9879\u9488\u5bf9100\u4eba\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u548c70\u4eba\u7684\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "Sigma Worksheet\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5176\u751f\u6210\u7684SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u53c2\u8003\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u8868\u660e\uff0cSigma Worksheet\u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Sigma Worksheet\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6613\u7528\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u662f\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

The unstructured data of digital hyperspace can be elegantly represented, traversed, and transformed via the mathematics of hypergraphs, hypersparse matrices, and associative array algebra. This paper explores a novel mathematical concept, the semilink, that combines pairs of semirings to provide the essential operations for graph analytics, database operations, and machine learning. The GraphBLAS standard currently supports hypergraphs, hypersparse matrices, the mathematics required for semilinks, and seamlessly performs graph, network, and matrix operations. With the addition of key based indices (such as pointers to strings) and semilinks, GraphBLAS can become a richer associative array algebra and be a plug-in replacement for spreadsheets, database tables, and data centric operating systems, enhancing the navigation of unstructured data found in digital hyperspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u534a\u94fe\u63a5\u201d\uff08semilink\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408GraphBLAS\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u8d85\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3001\u904d\u5386\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u5b57\u8d85\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5145\u65a5\u7740\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u3001\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u3001\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4f18\u96c5\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u8868\u793a\u3001\u904d\u5386\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u2014\u2014\u534a\u94fe\u63a5\uff08semilink\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u534a\u73af\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u672c\u8fd0\u7b97\u3002\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\u5c06\u4e0eGraphBLAS\u6807\u51c6\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728GraphBLAS\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u57fa\u4e8e\u952e\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u534a\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u6210\u4e3a\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6570\u7ec4\u4ee3\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u66ff\u4ee3\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8868\u548c\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u534a\u94fe\u63a5\u548cGraphBLAS\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u5c06\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u8d85\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

As examples of non-conforming data, we consider (i) a dataset of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences labelled by disease antigen and (ii) a dataset of sequenced TCR repertoires labelled by patient cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus, anticipating that both datasets contain signatures for diagnosing disease.

For humans and especially machines it becomes difficult to interpret such data properly. Therefore, spreadsheets are often converted to a more explicit, formal and structured form, for example, to a knowledge graph. However, if a data maintenance strategy has been missing and user-generated data becomes \"messy\", the construction of knowledge graphs will be a challenging task. In this paper, we catalog several of those challenges and propose an interactive approach to solve them. Our approach includes a graphical user interface which enables knowledge engineers to bulk-annotate spreadsheet cells with extracted information. Based on the cells' annotations a knowledge graph is ultimately formed. Using five spreadsheets from an industrial scenario, we built a 25k-triple graph during our evaluation.

Our collaboration with LTCH&S was initiated to facilitate the increasingly challenging task of scheduling nursing staff and reduce high absenteeism rate observed among the part-time nurses. We developed a spreadsheet-based scheduling tool to automate the generation of schedules and incorporate nurses' preferences for different shifts into the schedules. At the core of the scheduling tool is a hierarchical optimization model that generates a feasible schedule with the highest total preference score while satisfying the maximum possible demand. Feasible schedules had to abide by a set of complex seniority requirements which prioritized more senior nurses when allocating the available shifts.

The prospect of increased simulation time resulting in slower design iteration forces architects to use simpler models, such as spreadsheets, when they want to iterate quickly on a design. However, the task of migrating from a simple simulation to one with more detail often requires multiple executions to find where simple models could be effective, which could be more expensive than running the detailed model in the first place. Also, architects must often rely on intuition to choose these simpler models, further complicating the problem.\n  In this work, we present a method of bridging the gap between simple and detailed simulation by monitoring simulation behavior online and automatically swapping out detailed models with simpler statistical approximations. We demonstrate the potential of our methodology by implementing it in the open-source simulator SVE-Cachesim to swap out the level one data cache (L1D) within a memory hierarchy. This proof of concept demonstrates that our technique can handle a non-trivial use-case in not just approximation of local time-invariant statistics, but also those that vary with time (e.g., the L1D is a form of a time-series function), and downstream side-effects (e.g., the L1D filters accesses for the level two cache). Our simulation swaps out the built-in cache model with only an 8% error in the simulated cycle count while using the approximated cache models for over 90% of the simulation, and our simpler models require two to eight times less computation per \"execution\" of the model", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u76d1\u63a7\u6a21\u62df\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u62df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u62df\u6240\u9700\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e5f\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u53d8\u6162\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u62df\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6b21\u6267\u884c\u624d\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u8fd0\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u901a\u5e38\u5fc5\u987b\u4f9d\u9760\u76f4\u89c9\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f7f\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u76d1\u63a7\u6a21\u62df\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u62df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u62df\u5668SVE-Cachesim\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66ff\u6362\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u7f13\u5b58\uff08L1D\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cL1D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cL1D\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e8c\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\uff09\u3002\u5728\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7f13\u5b58\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u5468\u671f\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec5\u4e3a8%\uff0c\u800c\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6bcf\u6b21\u201c\u6267\u884c\u201d\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e862\u52308\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u6a21\u62df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although useful, technique barriers, such as data analysis, visualization, and scripting, make the generation of a visual data story difficult. Existing authoring tools rely on users' skills and experiences, which are usually inefficient and still difficult. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual data story generating system, Calliope, which creates visual data stories from an input spreadsheet through an automatic process and facilities the easy revision of the generated story based on an online story editor. Particularly, Calliope incorporates a new logic-oriented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the data space given by the input spreadsheet to progressively generate story pieces (i.e., data facts) and organize them in a logical order. The importance of data facts is measured based on information theory, and each data fact is visualized in a chart and captioned by an automatically generated description. We evaluate the proposed technique through three example stories, two controlled experiments, and a series of interviews with 10 domain experts. Our evaluation shows that Calliope is beneficial to efficient visual data story generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Calliope\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6545\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u4ece\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u81ea\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6545\u4e8b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u5f88\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u5b58\u5728\u6280\u672f\u969c\u788d\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u3001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3001\u811a\u672c\u7f16\u5199\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Calliope\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e76\u6309\u903b\u8f91\u987a\u5e8f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u6570\u636e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u7ebf\u6545\u4e8b\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u6545\u4e8b\u3001\u4e24\u6b21\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5bf910\u4f4d\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8bbf\u8c08\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cCalliope\u7cfb\u7edf\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6545\u4e8b\u3002", "conclusion": "Calliope\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing text analytics systems usually accommodate a subset of these stages and often fail to address challenges related to data heterogeneity, provenance, workflow reusability and reproducibility, and compatibility with established practices.

Leam features an interactive user interface for running text analysis workflows, a new data model for managing multiple atomic and composite data types, and an expressive algebra that captures diverse sets of operations representing various stages of text analysis and enables coordination among different components of the system, including data, code, and visualizations.

While spreadsheets are widely used yet are challenging to interact with, especially on mobile devices, using them in VR has not been explored in depth. A special uniqueness of the domain is the contrast between the immersive and large display space afforded by VR, contrasted by the very limited interaction space that may be afforded for the information worker on the go, such as an airplane seat or a small work-space. To close this gap, we present a tool-set for enhancing spreadsheet interaction on tablets using immersive VR headsets and pen-based input. This combination opens up many possibilities for enhancing the productivity for spreadsheet interaction. We propose to use the space around and in front of the tablet for enhanced visualization of spreadsheet data and meta-data. For example, extending sheet display beyond the bounds of the physical screen, or easier debugging by uncovering hidden dependencies between sheet's cells. Combining the precise on-screen input of a pen with spatial sensing around the tablet, we propose tools for the efficient creation and editing of spreadsheets functions such as off-the-screen layered menus, visualization of sheets dependencies, and gaze-and-touch-based switching between spreadsheet tabs.

This often requires aggregating, reusing, and integrating heterogeneous information. Supplementary spreadsheets to articles are a key data source. Spreadsheets are popular because they are easy to read and write. However, spreadsheets are often difficult to reanalyze because they capture data ad hoc without schemas that define the objects, relationships, and attributes that they represent. To help researchers reuse and compose spreadsheets, we developed ObjTables, a toolkit that makes spreadsheets human- and machine-readable by combining spreadsheets with schemas and an object-relational mapping system. ObjTables includes a format for schemas; markup for indicating the class and attribute represented by each spreadsheet and column; numerous data types for scientific information; and high-level software for using schemas to read, write, validate, compare, merge, revision, and analyze spreadsheets. By making spreadsheets easier to reuse, ObjTables could enable unprecedented secondary meta-analyses. By making it easy to build new formats and associated software for new types of data, ObjTables can also accelerate emerging scientific fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "ObjTables\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u6620\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4f7f\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5177\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u5143\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u805a\u5408\u3001\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u6574\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u662f\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9a\u4e49\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86ObjTables\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e0e\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u6620\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002\u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5f0f\u683c\u5f0f\uff1b\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u548c\u5217\u6240\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u7c7b\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u79d1\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bfb\u53d6\u3001\u5199\u5165\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u5408\u5e76\u3001\u4fee\u8ba2\u548c\u5206\u6790\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u91cd\u7528\uff0cObjTables\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u5143\u5206\u6790\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u5176\u6613\u4e8e\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u683c\u5f0f\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0cObjTables\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "ObjTables\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8d4b\u80fd\u4e86\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u5143\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u65b0\u5174\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

End user programmers are forced to construct their data models from low level cells which we define as \"a data container or manipulator linked by user-intent to model their world and positioned to reflect its structure\". Spreadsheet cells are limited in what they may contain (scalar values) and the links between them are inherently hidden. This paper proposes a method of raising the level of abstraction of spreadsheets by \"redrawing the boundary\" of the cell. To expose the hidden linkage structure we transform spreadsheets into fine-grained graphs with operators and values as nodes. \"cells\" are then represented as hypergraph edges by drawing a boundary \"wall\" around a set of operator/data nodes. To extend what cells may contain and to create a higher level model of the spreadsheet we propose that researchers should seek techniques to redraw these boundaries to create higher level \"cells\" which will more faithfully represent the end-user's real world/mental model.

In order to fully exploit the opportunities opened by RPA, companies need to discover which specific routines may be automated, and how. In this setting, this paper addresses the problem of analyzing User Interaction (UI) logs in order to discover routines where a user transfers data from one spreadsheet or (Web) form to another. The paper maps this problem to that of discovering data transformations by example - a problem for which several techniques are available. The paper shows that a naive application of a state-of-the-art technique for data transformation discovery is computationally inefficient. Accordingly, the paper proposes two optimizations that take advantage of the information in the UI log and the fact that data transfers across applications typically involve copying alphabetic and numeric tokens separately. The proposed approach and its optimizations are evaluated using UI logs that replicate a real-life repetitive data transfer routine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u65e5\u5fd7\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff08RPA\uff09\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u4f8b\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u516c\u53f8\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u54ea\u4e9b\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u4f8b\u7a0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528RPA\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08UI\uff09\u65e5\u5fd7\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6216\uff08Web\uff09\u8868\u5355\u5411\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u8868\u5355\u4f20\u8f93\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f8b\u7a0b\u3002\u5c06\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u4f8b\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528UI\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u5b57\u6bcd\u6570\u5b57\u6807\u8bb0\u5206\u522b\u590d\u5236\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u53d1\u73b0\u6280\u672f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5229\u7528UI\u65e5\u5fd7\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u7279\u70b9\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5236\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u91cd\u590d\u6570\u636e\u4f20\u8f93\u4f8b\u7a0b\u7684UI\u65e5\u5fd7\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Due to the professionalism of software development, it has still been difficult for non-programmers to develop this kind of systems, even a small one. However, the development of SaaS brings forth the more feasibility of coding-free software development than before. Based on the SaaS architecture, this paper presents a set of theory and method for coding-free construction of a data management system, on which our contributions involve in a practical application platform, a set of construction method and a set of interface on data exchange. By abstracting the common features of data management systems, we design a universal web platform to quickly generate and publish customized system instances. Moreover, we propose a kind of method to develop a data management system using a specific requirements table in spreadsheet. The corresponding platform maps the requirements table into a system instance through parsing the table model and implementing the objective system in the running stage. Finally, we implement the proposed framework and deploy it on web. The empirical result demonstrates the feasibility and availability of the coding-free method in developing web data management systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSaaS\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u975e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u4e5f\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u4e91\u7aef\u90e8\u7f72\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u975e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u800cSaaS\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4f7f\u5f97\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSaaS\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528Web\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u548c\u53d1\u5e03\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u8868\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u53f0\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u5c06\u9700\u6c42\u8868\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\u5728Web\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f00\u53d1Web\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Taggle takes an item-centric, spreadsheet-like approach, visualizing each row in the source data individually using visual encodings for the cells. At the same time, Taggle introduces data-driven aggregation of data subsets. The aggregation strategy is complemented by interaction methods tailored to answer specific analysis questions, such as sorting based on multiple columns and rich data selection and filtering capabilities.

The paper considers the use of spreadsheets in two units of the organisation, academic registry and finance. Spreadsheet use is explored in terms of importance, training, experience, purpose, techniques deployed, size of spreadsheets created and sharing of spreadsheets. The implications of the results are then considered in terms of accurate reporting to external funding bodies such the funding councils, internal data integrity and internal data efficiencies. The results show a large volume of spreadsheets being created and used, that the profile of spreadsheet developers is typical of other studies of spreadsheet use and the need for the organisation to have clear principles and guidelines for the development of spreadsheet models in the organisation to ensure data integrity, reduce duplication of effort and to optimise the use of spreadsheets to meet the institutions goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e00\u9879\u5bf9\u82f1\u56fd\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u753b\u50cf\u5178\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u82f1\u56fd\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u4e2d\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5411\u5916\u90e8\u8d44\u52a9\u673a\u6784\u51c6\u786e\u62a5\u544a\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u82f1\u56fd\u4e00\u6240\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u673a\u6784\u7684\u5b66\u672f\u6ce8\u518c\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u90e8\u95e8\u8fdb\u884c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3001\u57f9\u8bad\u3001\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u76ee\u7684\u3001\u6280\u672f\u3001\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u6784\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u753b\u50cf\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8be5\u673a\u6784\u9700\u8981\u5236\u5b9a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u539f\u5219\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u6784\u9700\u8981\u5236\u5b9a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5f00\u53d1\u539f\u5219\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

The selection of students plays a crucial role in the project. On the one hand, they have officially finished their spreadsheet training - they know everything - while on the other hand, they do not need any training, since they are digital natives, to whom digital skills are assigned by birth. However, we found that the students had serious difficulties in solving the spreadsheet problems presented: so low were their results that it allowed us to form broad tendencies. Considering computational thinking, algorithmic skills, and knowledge transfer abilities, it is clear that those students performed better who used algorithm-based, multilevel array formulas instead of problem specific, unconnected built-in functions. Furthermore, we can conclude that students, regardless of their birth date and digital generation assigned to them, are in great need of official, high-mathability, algorithm-based training with expert teachers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e00\u5e74\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u4e25\u91cd\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u90a3\u4e9b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u6570\u7ec4\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u5185\u7f6e\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5b66\u751f\u9700\u8981\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u6570\u5b66\u80fd\u529b\u57f9\u8bad\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e00\u5e74\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u6311\u6218\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u201c\u6570\u5b57\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u201d\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u57f9\u8bad\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e00\u5e74\u7ea7\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u7ea7\u6570\u7ec4\u516c\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u5185\u7f6e\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u6210\u7ee9\u5f88\u4f4e\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u591a\u7ea7\u6570\u7ec4\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u7f6e\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u5176\u51fa\u751f\u65e5\u671f\u548c\u6240\u5c5e\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4ee3\u9645\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u6559\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u3001\u9ad8\u6570\u5b66\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u57f9\u8bad\u3002"}}

These spreadsheets are often hard to understand and track. And if the user does not protect them, there is a risk that the user randomly changes or erase formulas. The paper focuses on the stocks of products used in a blending process with a known recipe. Developing an application that can bring this data in a centralized form and that can assist the operator in decide is a necessity. When a programmer implements an application that uses data from plants he needs to consider one fundamental aspect as reading real-time data from the process. The real-time stock analysis application takes into account all the above elements. The application is easy to use by an operator in the command room of installation because of the planning algorithms integrated into it. The algorithms proposed and implemented in this paper have well-defined goals: identifying the ingredients needed to achieve the blending process for required quantities, determine the quantities of the finished product that can be made with the existing ingredients and determine the optimum quantities of the finished product.

As a spreadsheet, Hillview provides a high degree of interactivity that permits data analysts to explore information quickly along many dimensions while switching visualizations on a whim. To provide the required responsiveness, Hillview introduces visualization sketches, or vizketches, as a simple idea to produce compact data visualizations. Vizketches combine algorithmic techniques for data summarization with computer graphics principles for efficient rendering. While simple, vizketches are effective at scaling the spreadsheet by parallelizing computation, reducing communication, providing progressive visualizations, and offering precise accuracy guarantees.

D4M relies on associative arrays which combine properties of spreadsheets, databases, matrices, graphs, and networks, while providing rigorous mathematical guarantees, such as linearity. Streaming updates of D4M associative arrays put enormous pressure on the memory hierarchy. This work describes the design and performance optimization of an implementation of hierarchical associative arrays that reduces memory pressure and dramatically increases the update rate into an associative array. The parameters of hierarchical associative arrays rely on controlling the number of entries in each level in the hierarchy before an update is cascaded. The parameters are easily tunable to achieve optimal performance for a variety of applications. Hierarchical arrays achieve over 40,000 updates per second in a single instance. Scaling to 34,000 instances of hierarchical D4M associative arrays on 1,100 server nodes on the MIT SuperCloud achieved a sustained update rate of 1,900,000,000 updates per second. This capability allows the MIT SuperCloud to analyze extremely large streaming network data sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "D4M\u5e93\u5728\u6d41\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u5173\u8054\u6570\u7ec4\uff08hierarchical associative arrays\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5355\u5b9e\u4f8b\u53ef\u8fbe40,000\u6b21/\u79d2\uff0c\u96c6\u7fa4\u53ef\u8fbe1,900,000,000\u6b21/\u79d2\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u5927\u578b\u6d41\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "D4M\u5173\u8054\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u7ea7\u9020\u6210\u5de8\u5927\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6d41\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u5173\u8054\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6761\u76ee\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u538b\u529b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u6613\u4e8e\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u6570\u7ec4\u66f4\u65b0\u901f\u7387\u8d85\u8fc740,000\u6b21/\u79d2\u3002\u5728MIT SuperCloud\u4e0a\uff0c34,000\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42D4M\u5173\u8054\u6570\u7ec4\u5b9e\u4f8b\u57281,100\u4e2a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bcf\u79d21,900,000,000\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u4f7f\u5f97MIT SuperCloud\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u6790\u6781\u5176\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

Later, with the necessary adaptations, these tasks will be applied to the students. The tasks deal with modeling situations, in two- and three-dimensional geometric problems, in order to apply GeoGebra software in its analysis to illustrate its capabilities. The different windows of this software are used, namely the 2D and 3D windows, CAS window, spreadsheet and extra two dimensional windows in order to study cutting planes in solids and some surfaces. The tasks are presented so that any user, regardless of the degree of knowledge they have of the software, can follow them, being supported in scripts with some indications of the tools and commands to use. Designed for the teaching and learning of Mathematics, from a STEAM approach, these tasks allow connections with other Sciences and the Arts, and allow the development of projects using and consolidating relevant mathematical contents. These tasks are part of the proposals of activities of the participants of the Training Courses for Trainers in GeoGebra for Portuguese Speaking Countries, which from 2019 have an impact on the STEAM approach. These courses are carried out with the high sponsorship of the Organization of Ibero-American States for Education, Science and Culture (OEI).

While an insight into data uncertainty can help in making better informed decisions, prior research suggests that people often use informal heuristics to reason with probabilities, which leads to incorrect conclusions. Moreover, people often ignore or simplify uncertainty. To understand how people currently encounter and deal with uncertainty in spreadsheets, we conducted an interview study with 11 spreadsheet users from a range of domains. We found that how people deal with uncertainty is influenced by the role the spreadsheet plays in people's work and the user's aims. Spreadsheets are used as a database, template, calculation tool, notepad and exploration tool. In doing so, participants' aims were to compute and compare different scenarios, understand something about the nature of the uncertainty in their situation, and translate the complexity of data uncertainty into simplified presentations to other people, usually decision-makers. Spreadsheets currently provide limited tools to support these aims, and participants had various workarounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbf\u8c08\u8c03\u67e5\u4e8611\u540d\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7528\u6237\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u53d7\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u76ee\u6807\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u901a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7528\u6237\u7ecf\u5e38\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5e38\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u6216\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u906d\u9047\u548c\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u768411\u540d\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bbf\u8c08\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u7528\u6237\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u53d7\u5230\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5728\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u60c5\u666f\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u3001\u7b80\u5316\u5448\u73b0\u7ed9\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u6b64\u652f\u6301\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u5404\u79cd\u53d8\u901a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8f85\u52a9\u4ed6\u4eec\u3002"}}

The systematic review of their application to simulating artificial neural networks is performed. The authors distinguish basic approaches to solving the problem of network computer simulation training in the spreadsheet environment, joint application of spreadsheets and tools of neural network simulation, application of third-party add-ins to spreadsheets, development of macros using the embedded languages of spreadsheets; use of standard spreadsheet add-ins for non-linear optimization, creation of neural networks in the spreadsheet environment without add-ins and macros. After analyzing a collection of writings of 1890-1950, the research determines the role of the scientific journal \"Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics\", its founder Nicolas Rashevsky and the scientific community around the journal in creating and developing models and methods of computational neuroscience. There are identified psychophysical basics of creating neural networks, mathematical foundations of neural computing and methods of neuroengineering (image recognition, in particular). The role of Walter Pitts in combining the descriptive and quantitative theories of training is discussed. It is shown that to acquire neural simulation competences in the spreadsheet environment, one should master the models based on the historical and genetic approach. It is indicated that there are three groups of models, which are promising in terms of developing corresponding methods - the continuous two-factor model of Rashevsky, the discrete model of McCulloch and Pitts, and the discrete-continuous models of Householder and Landahl.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u53d1\u5c55\u548c\u5173\u952e\u4eba\u7269\uff08\u5982Nicolas Rashevsky\u548cWalter Pitts\uff09\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u578b\uff08Rashevsky\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4e24\u56e0\u7d20\u6a21\u578b\u3001McCulloch\u548cPitts\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53caHouseholder\u548cLandahl\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u638c\u63e1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u8be5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u8be5\u6587\u7ae0\u65e8\u5728\u9610\u660e\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u5c06\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9014\u5f84\uff08\u5982\u8054\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u63d2\u4ef6\u3001\u5b8f\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u63d2\u4ef6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u63d2\u4ef6\u548c\u5b8f\u521b\u5efa\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u67901890-1950\u5e74\u7684\u8457\u4f5c\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u300a\u6570\u5b66\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u516c\u62a5\u300b\u3001\u5176\u521b\u59cb\u4ebaNicolas Rashevsky\u53ca\u5176\u79d1\u5b66\u793e\u533a\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u8ba1\u7b97\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u521b\u5efa\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86Walter Pitts\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7f51\u7edc\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u300a\u6570\u5b66\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u516c\u62a5\u300b\u3001Nicolas Rashevsky\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u79d1\u5b66\u793e\u533a\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5de5\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8981\u83b7\u5f97\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u638c\u63e1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e09\u7ec4\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08Rashevsky\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4e24\u56e0\u7d20\u6a21\u578b\u3001McCulloch\u548cPitts\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53caHouseholder\u548cLandahl\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u76f8\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u638c\u63e1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u9057\u4f20\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fRashevsky\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4e24\u56e0\u7d20\u6a21\u578b\u3001McCulloch\u548cPitts\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53caHouseholder\u548cLandahl\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8fde\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u76f8\u5173\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

One way to assess spreadsheet quality is to detect smells which attempt to identify parts of spreadsheets that are hard to comprehend or maintain and which are more likely to be the root source of bugs. Unfortunately, current spreadsheet smell detection techniques suffer from a number of drawbacks that lead to incorrect or redundant smell reports. For example, the same quality issue is often reported for every copy of a cell, which may overwhelm users. To deal with these issues, we propose to refine spreadsheet smells by exploiting inferred structural information for smell detection. We therefore first provide a detailed description of our static analysis approach to infer clusters and blocks of related cells. We then elaborate on how to improve existing smells by providing three example refinements of existing smells that incorporate information about cell groups and computation blocks. Furthermore, we propose three novel smell detection techniques that make use of the inferred spreadsheet structures. Empirical evaluation of the proposed techniques suggests that the refinements successfully reduce the number of incorrectly and redundantly reported smells, and novel deficits are revealed by the newly introduced smells.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u5355\u5143\u683c\u7c07\u548c\u5757\uff09\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6c14\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\u6216\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6c14\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u6216\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u590d\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u582a\u91cd\u8d1f\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u76f8\u5173\u5355\u5143\u683c\u7684\u7c07\u548c\u5757\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6c14\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u63a8\u65ad\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6c14\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u6c14\u5473\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u6c14\u5473\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6c14\u5473\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5168\u9762\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

In general, cognition of complex systems is facilitated by having a higher order mental model of the system in question to work with. We therefore present a concept for structure-aware understanding of and interaction with spreadsheets that extends previous work on structure inference in the domain. Following this concept, structural information is used to enrich visualizations, reactively enhance traditional user actions, and provide tools to proactively alter the overall spreadsheet makeup instead of individual cells The intended systems should, in first approximation, not replace common spreadsheet tools, but provide an additional layer of functionality alongside the established interface. In ongoing work, we therefore implemented a tool for structure inference and visualization along the common spreadsheet layout. Based on this framework, we plan to introduce the envisioned proactive and reactive interaction mechanics, and finally provide structure-aware unctionality as an add-in for common spreadsheet processors.

Existing synthesis systems either completely rely on deductive logic techniques that are extensively hand-engineered or on purely statistical models that need massive amounts of data, and in general fail to provide real-time synthesis on challenging benchmarks. In this work, we propose Neural Guided Deductive Search (NGDS), a hybrid synthesis technique that combines the best of both symbolic logic techniques and statistical models. Thus, it produces programs that satisfy the provided specifications by construction and generalize well on unseen examples, similar to data-driven systems. Our technique effectively utilizes the deductive search framework to reduce the learning problem of the neural component to a simple supervised learning setup. Further, this allows us to both train on sparingly available real-world data and still leverage powerful recurrent neural network encoders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by evaluating on real-world customer scenarios by synthesizing accurate programs with up to 12x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "NGDS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5408\u6210\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6f14\u7ece\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5408\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u5f15\u5bfc\u6f14\u7ece\u641c\u7d22\uff08NGDS\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u6f14\u7ece\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "NGDS\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5ba2\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5408\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8612\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "NGDS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5408\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Companies base decisions on information coming from spreadsheets. Unfortunately, spreadsheets are error-prone and this increases the risk that companies base their decisions on inaccurate information, which can lead to incorrect decisions and loss of money. In general, spreadsheet research is aimed to reduce the error-proneness of spreadsheets. Most research is concentrated on the use of formulas. However, there are other constructions in spreadsheets, like charts, pivot tables, and array formulas, that are also used to present decision support information to the user.

Due to these limitations, known error-like phenomena in freely available spreadsheet corpora cannot be classified with these taxonomies.\n  We propose Asheetoxy, a simple and phenomenon-oriented taxonomy that avoids the problematic term error altogether.

Without a transparency measure modelers cannot objectively evaluate methods and know which improves model transparency.\n  This paper proposes a definition for spreadsheet modeling transparency that is specific enough to create measures and automation tools for auditors to determine if a model meets transparency requirements. The definition also provides modelers the ability to objectively compare spreadsheet modeling methods to select which best meets their goals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8d22\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5efa\u6a21\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5e08\u8981\u6c42\u8d22\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6b64\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u53ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5efa\u6a21\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u5b9a\u4e49\u8db3\u591f\u5177\u4f53\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5e08\u5224\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u5ba2\u89c2\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5efa\u6a21\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002"}}

In this case study, we set out to apply this method of using online forum data to a specific issue---challenges that users face with Excel spreadsheets. Spreadsheets are a versatile and powerful processing tool if used properly. However, with versatility and power come errors, from both users and the software, which make using spreadsheets less effective. By scraping posts from the website Reddit, we collected a dataset of questions and complaints about Excel.

One well recognized common smell of spreadsheet formulae is nest-IF expressions, which have low readability and high cognitive cost for users, and are error-prone during reuse or maintenance. However, end users usually lack essential programming language knowledge and skills to tackle or even realize the problem. The previous research work has made very initial attempts in this aspect, while no effective and automated approach is currently available.\n  This paper firstly proposes an AST-based automated approach to systematically refactoring nest-IF formulae. The general idea is two-fold. First, we detect and remove logic redundancy on the AST. Second, we identify higher-level semantics that have been fragmented and scattered, and reassemble the syntax using concise built-in functions. A comprehensive evaluation has been conducted against a real-world spreadsheet corpus, which is collected in a leading IT company for research purpose. The results with over 68,000 spreadsheets with 27 million nest-IF formulae reveal that our approach is able to relieve the smell of over 99\\% of nest-IF formulae. Over 50% of the refactorings have reduced nesting levels of the nest-IFs by more than a half. In addition, a survey involving 49 participants indicates that for most cases the participants prefer the refactored formulae, and agree on that such automated refactoring approach is necessary and helpful.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unexpected Error", "motivation": "Error code: 429 - [{'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.

By automatically executing user-defined test rules, our approach is able to detect semantic faults. It also protects all collaborating spreadsheet users from introducing faults during maintenance, even if only few end-users specify test rules. To evaluate Spreadsheet Guardian, we implemented a representative testing technique as an add-in for Microsoft Excel.\n  We evaluated the testing technique in two empirical evaluations with 29 end-users and 42 computer science students. The results indicate that the technique is easy to learn and to apply. Furthermore, after finishing maintenance, participants with spreadsheets \"protected\" by the technique are more realistic about the correctness of their spreadsheets than participants who employ only \"classic\", non-interactive test rules based on static analysis techniques.

There are two main challenges in programmatically joining web data with relational data. First, most websites do not expose a direct interface to obtain tabular data, so the user needs to formulate a logic to get to different webpages for each input row in the relational table. Second, after reaching the desired webpage, the user needs to write complex scripts to extract the relevant data, which is often conditioned on the input data. Since many data scientists and end-users come from diverse backgrounds, writing such complex regular-expression based logical scripts to perform data integration tasks is unfortunately often beyond their programming expertise.\n  We present WebRelate, a system that allows users to join semi-structured web data with relational data in spreadsheets using input-output examples. WebRelate decomposes the web data integration task into two sub-tasks of i) URL learning and ii) input-dependent web extraction. The first sub-task generates the URLs for the webpages containing the desired data for all rows in the relational table. WebRelate achieves this by learning a string transformation program using a few example URLs. The second sub-task uses examples of desired data to be extracted from the corresponding webpages and learns a program to extract the data for the other rows. We design expressive domain-specific languages for URL generation and web data extraction, and present efficient synthesis algorithms for learning programs in these DSLs from few input-output examples. We evaluate WebRelate on 88 real-world web data integration tasks taken from online help forums and Excel product team, and show that WebRelate can learn the desired programs within few seconds using only 1 example for the majority of the tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "WebRelate\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u793a\u4f8b\u5e2e\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3aURL\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7edc\u6e90\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0d\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f4\u63a5\u83b7\u53d6\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u9700\u8981\u7f16\u5199\u590d\u6742\u7684\u811a\u672c\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u6237\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "WebRelate\u5c06\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3aURL\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8f6c\u6362\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u751f\u6210URL\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "WebRelate\u572888\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u51e0\u79d2\u949f\u5185\u5b66\u4e60\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u53ea\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "WebRelate\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u5728URL\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

They appear as serializers and deserializers, as database views and view updaters, and more. Manually building bidirectional transformations---by writing two separate functions that are intended to be inverses---is tedious and error prone. A better approach is to use a domain-specific language in which both directions can be written as a single expression. However, these domain-specific languages can be difficult to program in, requiring programmers to manage fiddly details while working in a complex type system.\n  To solve this, we present Optician, a tool for type-directed synthesis of bijective string transformers. The inputs to Optician are two ordinary regular expressions representing two data formats and a few concrete examples for disambiguation. The output is a well-typed program in Boomerang (a bidirectional language based on the theory of lenses). The main technical challenge involves navigating the vast program search space efficiently enough. Unlike most prior work on type-directed synthesis, our system operates in the context of a language with a rich equivalence relation on types (the theory of regular expressions). We synthesize terms of a equivalent language and convert those generated terms into our lens language. We prove the correctness of our synthesis algorithm. We also demonstrate empirically that our new language changes the synthesis problem from one that admits intractable solutions to one that admits highly efficient solutions. We evaluate Optician on a benchmark suite of 39 examples including both microbenchmarks and realistic examples derived from other data management systems including Flash Fill, a tool for synthesizing string transformations in spreadsheets, and Augeas, a tool for bidirectional processing of Linux system configuration files.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unexpected Error", "motivation": "Error code: 429 - [{'error': {'code': 429, 'message': 'You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
