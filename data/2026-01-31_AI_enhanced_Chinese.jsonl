Although LLMs have shown remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks, evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model progress in this important area.\n  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 28K questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills -- including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI GPT-5 and DeepSeek R1 score only around 69\\% and 57\\% respectively, suggesting significant room for improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing foundation models for structured data processing and analysis.\n  Our code and data are available at https://github.com/MMTU-Benchmark/MMTU and https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMTU-benchmark/MMTU.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MMTU\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b25\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u8d85\u8fc728000\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8868\u683c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u50cfOpenAI GPT-5\u548cDeepSeek R1\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728MMTU\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u8fdc\u975e\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u7528\u6237\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8868\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5MMTU\uff0c\u5305\u542b25\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u683c\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8d85\u8fc728000\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "MMTU\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5305\u62ecOpenAI GPT-5\u548cDeepSeek R1\u5728\u5185\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a69%\u548c57%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "MMTU\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In order to calculate spreadsheet similarity, our method converts spreadsheets into cell-level embeddings and then uses aggregation techniques like Chamfer and Hausdorff distances. Experiments across template families demonstrate superior unsupervised clustering performance compared to the graph-based Mondrian baseline, achieving perfect template reconstruction (Adjusted Rand Index of 1.00 versus 0.90) on the FUSTE dataset.

The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers.

Our motivation is to find methods of merging engineering models that do not require consensus (agreement) among the authors of the models being merged, a condition fulfilled by our method because theory and model morphisms are semantics-preserving.

However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use the Formula as the executable representation for solving complex reasoning on tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct \\texttt{FromulaQA}, a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset from existing datasets. In addition, we propose \\texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables simultaneously, which decodes answers and Formulas with a single LLM backbone.

Although it is hard for most investigators to remember all the guiding principles associated with FAIR data, there is one overarching requirement: The data need to be annotated with rich, discipline-specific, standardized metadata. The Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR) builds technology that enables scientists to encode metadata standards as templates that enumerate the attributes of different kinds of experiments. These metadata templates capture preferences regarding how data should be described and what a third party needs to know to make sense of the datasets. CEDAR templates describing community metadata preferences have been used to standardize metadata for a variety of scientific consortia. They have been used as the basis for data-annotation systems that acquire metadata through Web forms or through spreadsheets, and they can help correct metadata to ensure adherence to standards. Like the declarative knowledge bases that underpinned intelligent systems decades ago, CEDAR templates capture the knowledge in symbolic form, and they allow that knowledge to be applied in a variety of settings.

To better understand how personal (self-efficacy), social (reputational gains, trust between colleagues), and software-related (codification effort) variables influence spreadsheet KS intention, we conducted a multiple regressions analysis based on survey data from spreadsheet users (n=100) in administrative and finance roles. We found that high levels of spreadsheet self-efficacy and a perception that sharing would result in reputational gains predicted higher KS intention, but individuals who found knowledge codification effortful showed lower KS intention. We also observed that regardless of occupation, users tended to report a lower sense of self-efficacy in their general spreadsheet proficiency, despite also reporting high self-efficacy in spreadsheet use for job-related contexts. Our findings suggest that acknowledging and designing for these social and personal variables can help avoid situations where experienced individuals refrain unnecessarily from sharing, with implications for spreadsheet design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e2a\u4eba\uff08\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\uff09\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\uff08\u58f0\u8a89\u6536\u76ca\u3001\u540c\u4e8b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\uff09\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u7f16\u7e82\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff09\u53d8\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u610f\u613f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u4e2a\u4eba\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u53d8\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u610f\u613f\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u884c\u653f\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7528\u6237\uff08n=100\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5143\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u548c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u58f0\u8a89\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u4f46\u90a3\u4e9b\u8ba4\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7e82\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u610f\u613f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u4f55\u79cd\u804c\u4e1a\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u62a5\u544a\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u627f\u8ba4\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u53d8\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u907f\u514d\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u5730\u907f\u514d\u5206\u4eab\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Often, the user doesn't know how to identify or access the right data source. This problem is compounded even further if multiple (and potentially siloed) data sources must be assembled to derive the answer. Recently, various Text-to-SQL applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) have addressed some of these problems by enabling users to ask questions in natural language. However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they fail to cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this paper, we address heterogeneity by introducing the siwarex platform, which enables seamless natural language access to both databases and APIs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of siwarex, we extend the popular Spider dataset and benchmark by replacing some of its tables by data retrieval APIs.

Curation is divided into discrete components, with a schema-centric focus for auditable restructuring of complex and scattered tabular data to conform to a destination schema. Task separation allows development of software and analysis without source data being present. Transformations are captured as high-level sequential scripts describing schema-to-schema mappings, reducing complexity and resource requirements.

The slow evolution of Excel from an automation tool for ledgers to an IDE for analytics explains why many people have not noticed that Excel includes a fully functional database, an OLAP Engine, multiple statistical programming languages, multiple third-party software libraries, dynamic charts, and real time data connectors. The simplicity of accessing these multiple tools is a low-code framework controlled from the Excel tool that is effectively an IDE. Once we acknowledge Excel's shift from a desk top application to an IDE for analytics, the importance of establishing a comprehensive risk framework for managing this distinctive development environment becomes clear.

We propose three self-supervised challenges with corresponding evaluation metrics to comprehensively evaluate VLMs on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), spatial perception, and visual format recognition. Additionally, we utilize the spreadsheet table detection task to assess the overall performance of VLMs by integrating these challenges. To probe VLMs more finely, we propose three spreadsheet-to-image settings: column width adjustment, style change, and address augmentation. We propose variants of prompts to address the above tasks in different settings. Notably, to leverage the strengths of VLMs in understanding text rather than two-dimensional positioning, we propose to decode cell values on the four boundaries of the table in spreadsheet boundary detection. Our findings reveal that VLMs demonstrate promising OCR capabilities but produce unsatisfactory results due to cell omission and misalignment, and they notably exhibit insufficient spatial and format recognition skills, motivating future work to enhance VLMs' spreadsheet data comprehension capabilities using our methods to generate extensive spreadsheet-image pairs in various settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u4efb\u52a1\uff08OCR\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u8868\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5217\u5bbd\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u6837\u5f0f\u66f4\u6539\u3001\u5730\u5740\u589e\u5f3a\uff09\u6765\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u63a2\u6d4bVLM\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdbVLM\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4efb\u52a1\uff08OCR\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u683c\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8868\u683c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30VLM\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5217\u5bbd\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u6837\u5f0f\u66f4\u6539\u3001\u5730\u5740\u589e\u5f3a\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u63a2\u6d4bVLM\u3002\u5728\u8868\u683c\u8fb9\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u5229\u7528VLM\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u8868\u683c\u56db\u4e2a\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5355\u5143\u683c\u503c\u3002", "result": "VLM\u5728OCR\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5355\u5143\u683c\u9057\u6f0f\u548c\u9519\u4f4d\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002VLM\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

These complex tasks require AI to continuously summarize and improve. Current research often overlooks the importance of converting real-time task experiences into system memory and differentiating the value of existing knowledge for future reference. This paper addresses these issues by evolving external memory models into Memory-Loop Networks for timely memorization and experience referencing. We also enhance a RAG mechanism with knowledge precision segmentation to utilize memory based on value differentiation, and design the MaxMind model for SOTG accordingly.To demonstrate our approach, we developed MaxMind4Sheet, an electronic spreadsheet processing system aligned with the MaxMind philosophy. Comparative experiments with SheetCopilot have demonstrated that the accumulation and recycling of task memories lead to a steady enhancement in task success rate, with an improvement rate of approximately 3%-6% per round in this implementation example. Note that as the memories continue to grow, this cumulative improvement may be substantial. The inclusion of memory recycling can also boost the system's task execution efficiency by up to 25%, and it can address the retraining issue faced by LLMs when handling specialized tasks through memories transfer.These suggest that MaxMind has significant potential to enhance the capabilities and productivity of LLM systems in SOTG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6210\uff08SOTG\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u533a\u5206\u7684RAG\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5MaxMind\u6a21\u578b\u548cMaxMind4Sheet\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5c06\u5b9e\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee5\u53ca\u533a\u5206\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8eAI\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6210\uff08SOTG\uff09\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\uff08Memory-Loop Networks\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u53ca\u65f6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u4ef7\u503c\u533a\u5206\u6765\u5229\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86MaxMind\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5904\u7406SOTG\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "MaxMind4Sheet\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0eSheetCopilot\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u56de\u6536\u4f7f\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7a33\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea63%-6%\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad825%\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e13\u4e1a\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "MaxMind\u6a21\u578b\u5728SOTG\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u79ef\u7d2f\u3001\u4ef7\u503c\u533a\u5206\u5229\u7528\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

In recent years, it has been coupled with machine learning in order to improve the process of phenotyping plants by increasing efficiency in handling large datasets and developing methods for the extraction of specific traits. Previous studies have developed methods to advance these challenges through the application of deep neural networks in tandem with automated cameras; however, the datasets being studied often excluded physical labels. In this study, we used a dataset provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory with 1,672 images of Populus Trichocarpa with white labels displaying treatment (control or drought), block, row, position, and genotype. Optical character recognition (OCR) was used to read these labels on the plants, image segmentation techniques in conjunction with machine learning algorithms were used for morphological classifications, machine learning models were used to predict treatment based on those classifications, and analyzed encoded EXIF tags were used for the purpose of finding leaf size and correlations between phenotypes. We found that our OCR model had an accuracy of 94.31% for non-null text extractions, allowing for the information to be accurately placed in a spreadsheet. Our classification models identified leaf shape, color, and level of brown splotches with an average accuracy of 62.82%, and plant treatment with an accuracy of 60.08%.

Today, spreadsheets are used by billions of users to manipulate tables, most of whom are neither database experts nor professional programmers.\n  Despite the success of spreadsheets, authoring complex formulas remains challenging, as non-technical users need to look up and understand non-trivial formula syntax. To address this pain point, we leverage the observation that there is often an abundance of similar-looking spreadsheets in the same organization, which not only have similar data, but also share similar computation logic encoded as formulas. We develop an Auto-Formula system that can accurately predict formulas that users want to author in a target spreadsheet cell, by learning and adapting formulas that already exist in similar spreadsheets, using contrastive-learning techniques inspired by \"similar-face recognition\" from compute vision.\n  Extensive evaluations on over 2K test formulas extracted from real enterprise spreadsheets show the effectiveness of Auto-Formula over alternatives.

These users are often interested in data-centric tasks, such as spreadsheet manipulation and data wrangling, which are hard to solve if the intent is only communicated using a natural-language description, without including the data. But how do we decide how much data and which data to include in the prompt? This paper makes two contributions towards answering this question. First, we create a dataset of real-world NL-to-code tasks manipulating tabular data, mined from StackOverflow posts. Second, we introduce a cluster-then-select prompting technique, which adds the most representative rows from the input data to the LLM prompt. Our experiments show that LLM performance is indeed sensitive to the amount of data passed in the prompt, and that for tasks with a lot of syntactic variation in the input table, our cluster-then-select technique outperforms a random selection baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165", "motivation": "LLM\u6b63\u9010\u6e10\u53d6\u4ee3StackOverflow\u7b49\u8bba\u575b\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7279\u522b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u548c\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u4eceStackOverflow\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u7684\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u64cd\u4f5c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8be5\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u884c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230LLM\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5bf9\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u8bed\u6cd5\u53d8\u52a8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6570\u636e\u884c\u5230\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u540e\u9009\u62e9\u6280\u672f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
