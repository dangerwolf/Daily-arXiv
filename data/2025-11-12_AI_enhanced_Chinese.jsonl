To quantify spreadsheet similarity, we introduce a hybrid distance metric that combines semantic embeddings, data type information, and spatial positioning. In order to calculate spreadsheet similarity, our method converts spreadsheets into cell-level embeddings and then uses aggregation techniques like Chamfer and Hausdorff distances. Experiments across template families demonstrate superior unsupervised clustering performance compared to the graph-based Mondrian baseline, achieving perfect template reconstruction (Adjusted Rand Index of 1.00 versus 0.90) on the FUSTE dataset. Our approach facilitates large-scale automated template discovery, which in turn enables downstream applications such as retrieval-augmented generation over tabular collections, model training, and bulk data cleaning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Chamfer\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u805a\u5408\u6280\u672f\u3002\u5728FUSTE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u677f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6a21\u677f\u53d1\u73b0\u4ee5\u53ca\u540e\u7eed\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5230\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5355\u5143\u683c\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528Chamfer\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u805a\u5408\u6280\u672f\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684Mondrian\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u5728FUSTE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u91cd\u5efa\uff08Adjusted Rand Index\u4e3a1.00\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e3a0.90\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6a21\u677f\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982\u8868\u683c\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6279\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u3002"}}

The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others.

Our motivation is to find methods of merging engineering models that do not require consensus (agreement) among the authors of the models being merged, a condition fulfilled by our method because theory and model morphisms are semantics-preserving. We describe a case study of this methodology on a real-world oil and gas calculation at a major energy company, describing the theories and models that arise when integrating two different casing pressure test (MASP) calculation spreadsheets constructed by two non-interacting engineers.

However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use the Formula as the executable representation for solving complex reasoning on tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct \\texttt{FromulaQA}, a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset from existing datasets.

TableTalk guides programmers through structured plans based on professional workflows, generating three potential next steps to adapt plans to programmer needs. It uses pre-defined tools to generate spreadsheet components and incrementally build spreadsheets. In a study with 20 programmers, TableTalk produced higher-quality spreadsheets 2.3 times more likely to be preferred than the baseline. It reduced cognitive load and thinking time by 12.6%.

Although LLMs have shown remarkable progress in working with tables (e.g., in spreadsheet and database copilot scenarios), comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains limited. In contrast to an extensive and growing list of NLP benchmarks, evaluations of table-related tasks are scarce, and narrowly focus on tasks like NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks that professional users face. This gap limits our understanding and model progress in this important area.\n  In this work, we introduce MMTU, a large-scale benchmark with over 30K questions across 25 real-world table tasks, designed to comprehensively evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills -- including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 score only around 60%, suggesting significant room for improvement. We highlight key findings in our evaluation using MMTU and hope that this benchmark drives further advances in understanding and developing foundation models for structured data processing and analysis.

Although it is hard for most investigators to remember all the guiding principles associated with FAIR data, there is one overarching requirement: The data need to be annotated with rich, discipline-specific, standardized metadata. The Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR) builds technology that enables scientists to encode metadata standards as templates that enumerate the attributes of different kinds of experiments. These metadata templates capture preferences regarding how data should be described and what a third party needs to know to make sense of the datasets. CEDAR templates describing community metadata preferences have been used to standardize metadata for a variety of scientific consortia. They have been used as the basis for data-annotation systems that acquire metadata through Web forms or through spreadsheets, and they can help correct metadata to ensure adherence to standards. Like the declarative knowledge bases that underpinned intelligent systems decades ago, CEDAR templates capture the knowledge in symbolic form, and they allow that knowledge to be applied in a variety of settings. They provide a mechanism for scientific communities to create shared metadata standards and to encode their preferences for the application of those standards, and for deploying those standards in a range of intelligent systems to promote open science.", "AI": {"tldr": "Unexpected Error", "motivation": "Error code: 503 - [{'error': {'code': 503, 'message': 'The model is overloaded.

To better understand how personal (self-efficacy), social (reputational gains, trust between colleagues), and software-related (codification effort) variables influence spreadsheet KS intention, we conducted a multiple regressions analysis based on survey data from spreadsheet users (n=100) in administrative and finance roles. We found that high levels of spreadsheet self-efficacy and a perception that sharing would result in reputational gains predicted higher KS intention, but individuals who found knowledge codification effortful showed lower KS intention. We also observed that regardless of occupation, users tended to report a lower sense of self-efficacy in their general spreadsheet proficiency, despite also reporting high self-efficacy in spreadsheet use for job-related contexts. Our findings suggest that acknowledging and designing for these social and personal variables can help avoid situations where experienced individuals refrain unnecessarily from sharing, with implications for spreadsheet design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u975e\u6b63\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u6237\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u83b7\u53d6\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u548c\u58f0\u8a89\u6536\u76ca\u9884\u793a\u7740\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u610f\u613f\uff0c\u800c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5927\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u610f\u613f\u3002\u7528\u6237\u5728\u901a\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u4e2a\u4eba\uff08\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\uff09\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\uff08\u58f0\u8a89\u6536\u76ca\u3001\u540c\u4e8b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\uff09\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff09\u53d8\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u6237\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u610f\u613f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9100\u540d\u884c\u653f\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5143\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u548c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5206\u4eab\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u58f0\u8a89\u6536\u76ca\u9884\u793a\u7740\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u610f\u613f\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u7801\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5927\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u610f\u613f\u3002\u65e0\u8bba\u804c\u4e1a\u5982\u4f55\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u666e\u904d\u62a5\u544a\u5176\u901a\u7528\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u4f7f\u7528\u5374\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6548\u80fd\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u627f\u8ba4\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e9b\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u907f\u514d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u5730\u907f\u514d\u5206\u4eab\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u8868\u683c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u542f\u793a\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}
