The world is arguably made up, not of\npixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events)\nwith properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the\nperception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on\nmodeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is\nin terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find\ntheir most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational\nformats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine\nlearning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers\nand other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field\nthat studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,\nstatistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational\nlearning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted\nrelations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence."}

In\na spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data\nby computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others.

We formalize the\nproblem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot\ntables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of\nrecommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works\ninadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to\nconsider the problem of pivot table diversification.\n  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted\ndiverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k\nrecommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is\ninsightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences,\nwhile also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each\nother, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical\ncontributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a\nsingle pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a\nscalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot\ntables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce\nthe combinatorial search space.

We construct our\nRepository with a systematic review of taxonomies and other structured\nclassifications of AI risk followed by an expert consultation. We develop our\ntaxonomies of AI risk using a best-fit framework synthesis. Our high-level\nCausal Taxonomy of AI Risks classifies each risk by its causal factors (1)\nEntity: Human, AI; (2) Intentionality: Intentional, Unintentional; and (3)\nTiming: Pre-deployment; Post-deployment. Our mid-level Domain Taxonomy of AI\nRisks classifies risks into seven AI risk domains: (1) Discrimination &\ntoxicity, (2) Privacy & security, (3) Misinformation, (4) Malicious actors &\nmisuse, (5) Human-computer interaction, (6) Socioeconomic & environmental, and\n(7) AI system safety, failures, & limitations.

In this paper,\nwe describe an end-to-end approach that supports spreadsheet-based entry of\nmetadata, while ensuring rigorous adherence to community-based metadata\nstandards and providing quality control. Our methods employ several key\ncomponents, including customizable templates that capture metadata standards\nand that can inform the spreadsheets that investigators use to author metadata,\ncontrolled terminologies and ontologies for defining metadata values that can\nbe accessed directly from a spreadsheet, and an interactive Web-based tool that\nallows users to rapidly identify and fix errors in their spreadsheet-based\nmetadata.

The\ndecision involves choosing the right hardware and configuring a suitable set of\nparameters. However, comparing different accelerator design alternatives\nremains a complex task.

Synthetic data generation offers the potential to unlock sensitive\ndata, but generative models tend to memorise and regurgitate training data,\nwhich undermines the privacy goal. To remedy this, researchers have\nincorporated the mathematical framework of Differential Privacy (DP) into the\ntraining process of deep neural networks.

Furthermore,\nthese systems have focused independently on syntactic errors or semantic errors\nin strings, but ignore that strings often contain both syntactic and semantic\nsubstrings. We introduce DataVinci, a fully unsupervised string data error\ndetection and repair system. DataVinci learns regular-expression-based patterns\nthat cover a majority of values in a column and reports values that do not\nsatisfy such patterns as data errors. DataVinci can automatically derive edits\nto the data error based on the majority patterns and constraints learned over\nother columns without the need for further user interaction. To handle strings\nwith both syntactic and semantic substrings, DataVinci uses an LLM to abstract\n(and re-concretize) portions of strings that are semantic prior to learning\nmajority patterns and deriving edits. Because not all data can result in\nmajority patterns, DataVinci leverages execution information from an existing\nprogram (which reads the target data) to identify and correct data repairs that\nwould not otherwise be identified.

Based on the results, we\nintroduce a novel framework for generating MGVs by metaphoric image selection\nand an MGV construction. Specifically, MetaGlyph automatically selects\nmetaphors with corresponding images from online resources based on the input\ndata semantics. We then integrate a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that\nexplores the design of an MGV by associating visual elements with data\ndimensions given the data importance, semantic relevance, and glyph\nnon-overlap. The system also provides editing feedback that allows users to\ncustomize the MGVs according to their design preferences. We demonstrate the\nuse of MetaGlyph through a set of examples, one usage scenario, and validate\nits effectiveness through a series of expert interviews."}

Existing\ndeep learning methods for question answering on tabular data have various\nlimitations, such as having to feed the entire table as input into a neural\nnetwork model, making them unsuitable for most real-world applications. Since\nreal-world data might contain millions of rows, it may not entirely fit into\nthe memory. Moreover, data could be stored in live databases, which are updated\nin real-time, and it is impractical to serialize an entire database to a neural\nnetwork-friendly format each time it is updated.

In this paper, we introduce a novel visual\ndata story generating system, Calliope, which creates visual data stories from\nan input spreadsheet through an automatic process and facilities the easy\nrevision of the generated story based on an online story editor. Particularly,\nCalliope incorporates a new logic-oriented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm\nthat explores the data space given by the input spreadsheet to progressively\ngenerate story pieces (i.e., data facts) and organize them in a logical order.\nThe importance of data facts is measured based on information theory, and each\ndata fact is visualized in a chart and captioned by an automatically generated\ndescription. We evaluate the proposed technique through three example stories,\ntwo controlled experiments, and a series of interviews with 10 domain experts.\nOur evaluation shows that Calliope is beneficial to efficient visual data story\ngeneration."}

Text data analysis is an iterative, non-linear process with diverse\nworkflows spanning multiple stages, from data cleaning to visualization.\nExisting text analytics systems usually accommodate a subset of these stages\nand often fail to address challenges related to data heterogeneity, provenance,\nworkflow reusability and reproducibility, and compatibility with established\npractices. Based on a set of design considerations we derive from these\nchallenges, we propose Leam, a system that treats the text analysis process as\na single continuum by combining advantages of computational notebooks,\nspreadsheets, and visualization tools. Leam features an interactive user\ninterface for running text analysis workflows, a new data model for managing\nmultiple atomic and composite data types, and an expressive algebra that\ncaptures diverse sets of operations representing various stages of text\nanalysis and enables coordination among different components of the system,\nincluding data, code, and visualizations.

While spreadsheets\nare widely used yet are challenging to interact with, especially on mobile\ndevices, using them in VR has not been explored in depth. A special uniqueness\nof the domain is the contrast between the immersive and large display space\nafforded by VR, contrasted by the very limited interaction space that may be\nafforded for the information worker on the go, such as an airplane seat or a\nsmall work-space. To close this gap, we present a tool-set for enhancing\nspreadsheet interaction on tablets using immersive VR headsets and pen-based\ninput. This combination opens up many possibilities for enhancing the\nproductivity for spreadsheet interaction. We propose to use the space around\nand in front of the tablet for enhanced visualization of spreadsheet data and\nmeta-data. For example, extending sheet display beyond the bounds of the\nphysical screen, or easier debugging by uncovering hidden dependencies between\nsheet's cells. Combining the precise on-screen input of a pen with spatial\nsensing around the tablet, we propose tools for the efficient creation and\nediting of spreadsheets functions such as off-the-screen layered menus,\nvisualization of sheets dependencies, and gaze-and-touch-based switching\nbetween spreadsheet tabs.

To help researchers reuse and compose\nspreadsheets, we developed ObjTables, a toolkit that makes spreadsheets human-\nand machine-readable by combining spreadsheets with schemas and an\nobject-relational mapping system. ObjTables includes a format for schemas;\nmarkup for indicating the class and attribute represented by each spreadsheet\nand column; numerous data types for scientific information; and high-level\nsoftware for using schemas to read, write, validate, compare, merge, revision,\nand analyze spreadsheets.

Spreadsheet cells are limited in what they may contain\n(scalar values) and the links between them are inherently hidden. This paper\nproposes a method of raising the level of abstraction of spreadsheets by\n\"redrawing the boundary\" of the cell. To expose the hidden linkage structure we\ntransform spreadsheets into fine-grained graphs with operators and values as\nnodes. \"cells\" are then represented as hypergraph edges by drawing a boundary\n\"wall\" around a set of operator/data nodes. To extend what cells may contain\nand to create a higher level model of the spreadsheet we propose that\nresearchers should seek techniques to redraw these boundaries to create higher\nlevel \"cells\" which will more faithfully represent the end-user's real\nworld/mental model.

D4M relies on\nassociative arrays which combine properties of spreadsheets, databases,\nmatrices, graphs, and networks, while providing rigorous mathematical\nguarantees, such as linearity. Streaming updates of D4M associative arrays put\nenormous pressure on the memory hierarchy. This work describes the design and\nperformance optimization of an implementation of hierarchical associative\narrays that reduces memory pressure and dramatically increases the update rate\ninto an associative array. The parameters of hierarchical associative arrays\nrely on controlling the number of entries in each level in the hierarchy before\nan update is cascaded.

One well recognized common\nsmell of spreadsheet formulae is nest-IF expressions, which have low\nreadability and high cognitive cost for users, and are error-prone during reuse\nor maintenance. However, end users usually lack essential programming language\nknowledge and skills to tackle or even realize the problem. The previous\nresearch work has made very initial attempts in this aspect, while no effective\nand automated approach is currently available.\n  This paper firstly proposes an AST-based automated approach to systematically\nrefactoring nest-IF formulae. The general idea is two-fold. First, we detect\nand remove logic redundancy on the AST. Second, we identify higher-level\nsemantics that have been fragmented and scattered, and reassemble the syntax\nusing concise built-in functions. A comprehensive evaluation has been conducted\nagainst a real-world spreadsheet corpus, which is collected in a leading IT\ncompany for research purpose. The results with over 68,000 spreadsheets with 27\nmillion nest-IF formulae reveal that our approach is able to relieve the smell\nof over 99\\% of nest-IF formulae. Over 50% of the refactorings have reduced\nnesting levels of the nest-IFs by more than a half. In addition, a survey\ninvolving 49 participants indicates that for most cases the participants prefer\nthe refactored formulae, and agree on that such automated refactoring approach\nis necessary and helpful."}

However, many bad decisions taken due to faulty spreadsheets\nshow that these tools need serious quality assurance. Furthermore, while\ncollaboration on spreadsheets for maintenance tasks is common, there has been\nalmost no support for ensuring that the spreadsheets remain correct during this\nprocess.\n  We have developed an approach named Spreadsheet Guardian which separates the\nspecification of spreadsheet test rules from their execution. By automatically\nexecuting user-defined test rules, our approach is able to detect semantic\nfaults. It also protects all collaborating spreadsheet users from introducing\nfaults during maintenance, even if only few end-users specify test rules. To\nevaluate Spreadsheet Guardian, we implemented a representative testing\ntechnique as an add-in for Microsoft Excel.\n  We evaluated the testing technique in two empirical evaluations with 29\nend-users and 42 computer science students. The results indicate that the\ntechnique is easy to learn and to apply. Furthermore, after finishing\nmaintenance, participants with spreadsheets \"protected\" by the technique are\nmore realistic about the correctness of their spreadsheets than participants\nwho employ only \"classic\", non-interactive test rules based on static analysis\ntechniques. Hence, we believe Spreadsheet Guardian can be of use for\nbusiness-critical spreadsheets."}

There are two main challenges\nin programmatically joining web data with relational data. First, most websites\ndo not expose a direct interface to obtain tabular data, so the user needs to\nformulate a logic to get to different webpages for each input row in the\nrelational table. Second, after reaching the desired webpage, the user needs to\nwrite complex scripts to extract the relevant data, which is often conditioned\non the input data.

The first sub-task generates\nthe URLs for the webpages containing the desired data for all rows in the\nrelational table. WebRelate achieves this by learning a string transformation\nprogram using a few example URLs. The second sub-task uses examples of desired\ndata to be extracted from the corresponding webpages and learns a program to\nextract the data for the other rows. We design expressive domain-specific\nlanguages for URL generation and web data extraction, and present efficient\nsynthesis algorithms for learning programs in these DSLs from few input-output\nexamples.

They appear as serializers and\ndeserializers, as database views and view updaters, and more. Manually building\nbidirectional transformations---by writing two separate functions that are\nintended to be inverses---is tedious and error prone. A better approach is to\nuse a domain-specific language in which both directions can be written as a\nsingle expression. However, these domain-specific languages can be difficult to\nprogram in, requiring programmers to manage fiddly details while working in a\ncomplex type system.\n  To solve this, we present Optician, a tool for type-directed synthesis of\nbijective string transformers. The inputs to Optician are two ordinary regular\nexpressions representing two data formats and a few concrete examples for\ndisambiguation. The output is a well-typed program in Boomerang (a\nbidirectional language based on the theory of lenses). The main technical\nchallenge involves navigating the vast program search space efficiently enough.\nUnlike most prior work on type-directed synthesis, our system operates in the\ncontext of a language with a rich equivalence relation on types (the theory of\nregular expressions). We synthesize terms of a equivalent language and convert\nthose generated terms into our lens language. We prove the correctness of our\nsynthesis algorithm. We also demonstrate empirically that our new language\nchanges the synthesis problem from one that admits intractable solutions to one\nthat admits highly efficient solutions. We evaluate Optician on a benchmark\nsuite of 39 examples including both microbenchmarks and realistic examples\nderived from other data management systems including Flash Fill, a tool for\nsynthesizing string transformations in spreadsheets, and Augeas, a tool for\nbidirectional processing of Linux system configuration files."}
